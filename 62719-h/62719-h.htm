<span class="fs70">AN EXCITING INNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was the seventh inning, Frank Merriwell’s team
had not scored, while the Omaha Stars, who had been
putting up a hard game against the boys from the
East, had made two runs, one in the first inning and
one in the fifth.</p>

<p>Frank had been pitching a fine game, although his
wrist, sprained some time before, had not permitted
him to use the double-shoot. In the seventh inning,
with the very first ball he pitched, he gave his wrist
a twist that sent a shooting pain all the way to his
shoulder.</p>

<p>The ball went wide of the plate, and the batter did
not strike at it. When Bart Hodge returned the ball,
he knew something had happened, by the expression
on Frank’s face. Merry caught the ball with his
left hand and stood still, holding it.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” roared the excited crowd. “Make him
pitch!”</p>

<p>Still Frank seemed in no hurry. He took the ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
in his hand, while Bart gave the signal for a drop.
Merry shook his head, and Bart signed for an out.
Again Frank shook his head, assuming a position that
told the entire team he intended to use a high, straight
ball. But he did not pitch.</p>

<p>Dorrity, the captain and first-baseman of the Stars,
demanded of the umpire that Merriwell be compelled
to deliver the ball.</p>

<p>“Pitch the ball!” roared the crowd.</p>

<p>Even that did not seem to incite Frank to put it over.</p>

<p>“Two balls!” called the umpire, although Frank
had not again delivered the sphere to the bat.</p>

<p>“Ha!” shouted the crowd. “That’s the stuff!”</p>

<p>The second ball had been called on Merry as a
penalty for delaying the game for no good reason.</p>

<p>A grim look came into the face of the greatest
pitcher ever graduated from Yale. He did not kick
at the decision of the umpire, nor did he show great
haste in pitching after this.</p>

<p>“Call another!” cried several of the spectators.
“He’s in a hole, and he knows it!”</p>

<p>Frank settled himself firmly on the ground, just
as Bart was ready to start down to ask what was the
matter. Then he sent over a high, straight one that
would have been a ball had the batter let it alone.</p>

<p>But the batter hit it. The man with the stick happened
to be Hanson, the heavy hitter of the Stars,
and he tapped the ball a terrible crack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>Away sailed the sphere, going out on a line over
the infield, and Hanson’s legs took him flying down
to first.</p>

<p>Both Swiftwing and Gamp went after the ball, but
Frank saw at once that neither of them could catch it.</p>

<p>Swiftwing was a great runner, and he sped to cut
the ball off after it struck the ground.</p>

<p>Hanson crossed first and tore along to second,
urged by the roaring crowd.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge groaned as he saw the ball strike the
ground and go bounding away into left field, with
Swiftwing tearing after it.</p>

<p>“Home run! home run!” yelled the spectators, while
one of the home team raced down to third, to be on
hand there and send Hanson home as he came along.</p>

<p>Away out in the far extreme of left field Swiftwing
finally ran down the ball. But Hanson was almost to
third, and the spectators in the grand stand and on the
bleachers were certain he could reach home before the
ball could be sent in.</p>

<p>“Come home! come home!” they screamed.</p>

<p>Hanson crossed third, and the coacher sent him
right along.</p>

<p>In the meantime Swiftwing had picked up the ball
and given it a quick snap to Gamp, the long New
Hampshire youth, who was within two rods of him.
Joe turned with the ball in his hand, and saw Hanson
crossing third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Then Joe set his teeth and swung back the hand that
held the ball. The crowd expected he would throw
to Rattleton, on second. At first it seemed that he had
thrown to second, but had failed to get the range
correctly.</p>

<p>Then it was seen that Gamp had tried the seemingly
impossible task of throwing to the plate to cut
the runner off.</p>

<p>“Run, Hanson&mdash;run!” shouted the spectators.</p>

<p>Hanson was doing his best to beat the ball to the
plate, but that ball came on with amazing speed. It
was almost a “line throw” from the far outfield, and
the crowd was amazed by the manner in which the
ball hung up in the air instead of dropping to the
ground. It showed what wonderful force had been
put into the throw.</p>

<p>Hodge settled himself in position to take the ball,
and suddenly, as Hanson neared the plate, the coachers
shrieked for him to slide.</p>

<p>Hanson slid headlong, but Bart caught the ball
and “bored” it into his back, actually pinning him
to the ground while his hand was yet a foot from the
plate. He tried to squirm forward and reach the
plate, but the voice of the umpire called:</p>

<p>“Out!”</p>

<p>A hush fell on the witnesses of this amazing piece
of work. Only a moment before they had been roar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>ing
loudly, but, of a sudden, they were silent. Then
somebody with a hoarse voice roared:</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that for a throw!
Talk about a wing&mdash;that fellow’s got it!”</p>

<p>Somebody clapped his hands, and a general volley
of applause followed.</p>

<p>Hanson was filled with chagrin, for he had felt
confident of making a home run. He turned and
quarreled with the coacher who sent him home from
third, and would not believe the ball had been thrown
all the distance from the farthest outfield to the plate.</p>

<p>Jack, the second-baseman of the Stars, now took his
place to strike.</p>

<p>Merriwell had been rubbing his wrist as he walked
down into the box, after backing Hodge up on the
catch of Gamp’s throw, and the expression on his
face, had any one studied it, seemed to indicate a
troubled mind.</p>

<p>“If Dick were here,” he muttered, thinking of his
young brother, “we’d be all right.”</p>

<p>But Dick Merriwell was not there, having been left
behind in Wyoming, to remain at the side of Old Joe
Crowfoot, who had been shot and severely wounded.</p>

<p>Despite his youth, Frank’s brother had shown himself
a perfect little wizard as a pitcher, being able to
hold down heavy hitters. Just now he would be handy
to step into the box in Frank’s place, but he was far
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>And there was no other pitcher on the team able
to hold down the heavy hitters of the Stars. So Frank
set his teeth and resolved to pitch the game through
to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>Jack was a good hitter, but, up to this time, he had
been unable to touch Merriwell for a safe one. Frank
tried a high one, which the latter let pass. An out
followed, and another ball was called.</p>

<p>Then Merry tried a drop, but again he felt that
shooting pain, and the ball went wide.</p>

<p>Now Frank was forced to put the ball over, in order
to prevent the batter from walking to first. He used
speed, and kept it shoulder high, with a slight in
shoot.</p>

<p>Jack stepped forward and met the ball fairly, driving
it out on a line.</p>

<p>Carson jumped for the ball, touched it with his fingers,
but did not stop it. Jack reached first and
started for second, but Rattleton got the ball, and Carson
covered second in time to drive the runner back
to first.</p>

<p>Maloney, the next hitter, was tall, red-headed, and
freckle-faced. He rapped the very first ball that
Frank pitched, sending it down to Rattleton so hotly
that Harry fumbled, and the hitter was able to reach
first ahead of the throw.</p>

<p>“Everybody hits!” cried Dorrity, who was near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
third. “Get against it, Corrigan, old man! Drive
it out hard!”</p>

<p>Corrigan looked confident, but Frank caused him
to fan at the first ball delivered. Then Merry tried
to work the corners, but found himself rather wild,
and three balls were called.</p>

<p>“Now he’s got to put ’em over!” cried Dorrity.
“Wait it out!”</p>

<p>Frank took a chance and sent a straight one over.</p>

<p>Corrigan did not wait, but nailed the ball hard. It
went to Ready with the speed of a bullet. Ready put
his body in front of the ball, which took a nasty
bound and struck him fairly between the eyes, knocking
him over.</p>

<p>Ready was dazed, and by the time he had recovered
and got the ball, Jack was on third and Maloney on
second. Ready caught up the ball and swung his arm
to throw to first.</p>

<p>Frank saw that the throw would be useless, as
Corrigan was already too near the bag, and he shouted
for Ready to hold the ball.</p>

<p>Ready could not stop the swing of his arm, but he
held on to the ball long enough to throw it down at
his feet, and it bounded merrily away.</p>

<p>“Score!” yelled a coacher, and Jack made a jump
off third to go home.</p>

<p>The spectators rose up and whooped madly once
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Frank made a leap and got in front of the ball,
which he succeeded in stopping. Fortunately for him,
Jack saw this soon enough to dive back to third.</p>

<p>Merry recovered and drew back his hand to throw
to third, but instantly decided that it would be useless,
knowing that a team often goes to pieces and
loses a game in a single inning by getting to throwing
the ball round in a hasty and reckless manner, so
he held the sphere.</p>

<p>But the bases were full and but one man was out.
Something told Frank that he was in a bad box.
Still, he set his teeth and resolved to “pull out” if it
were possible.</p>

<p>The coachers were talking from both sides of the
diamond, and the excited crowd had not stopped its
roaring.</p>

<p>Hodge was pale, and there was a fierce gleam in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll hold ’em! Now we’ll hold ’em!” cried
Rattleton, from second.</p>

<p>“Talk about your stars!” exclaimed Ready. “I
saw a few that time!”</p>

<p>“They won’t get another hit, Merry,” assured Carson,
who was playing short.</p>

<p>“Put ’em right over,” advised Browning.</p>

<p>“All a dud-dud-dinged accident!” asserted Gamp,
from distant center garden.</p>

<p>Swiftwing and Carker were the only silent ones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
behind Merry, for even Hodge grimly asserted that
it was all right.</p>

<p>Then Merriwell resolved to use the double-shoot,
if it broke his wrist. Bart called for an out curve as
Dorrity stepped up to the plate; but Merry assumed
a position that told everybody on the team he meant
to use the famous reverse curve, which he alone could
command and control.</p>

<p>Bart knew Merry was desperate, for Frank had
told him he would not resort to that extreme in the
game.</p>

<p>Dorrity was cool enough, but the first ball seemed
just what he desired, and he bit at it. The reverse
curve fooled him nicely, and he did not touch the ball.</p>

<p>“One strike!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>Bart smiled grimly and nodded for another.
Frank used exactly the same sort of a curve, and
again Dorrity went after it and failed to connect.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s easy! it’s easy!” said Bart.</p>

<p>“A perfect snap,” assured Carson.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t hit one of them in fourteen million
years,” said Ready.</p>

<p>“He’ll think he’s got the jam-jims&mdash;I mean the jim-jams,”
came from Rattleton.</p>

<p>“Please let him hit it,” urged Browning. “I want
another put-out in this inning. He can’t hit it out of
the diamond.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>But Merry did not let up in the least. The very
next one was a speed ball, but Frank caused the
curves to reverse the other way, and Dorrity let it pass.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>Dorrity threw down his bat and started into the
diamond, yelling:</p>

<p>“What’s that? That ball didn’t come within a foot
of the plate!”</p>

<p>“Sit down!” commanded the umpire grimly.</p>

<p>Dorrity insisted on kicking, and the umpire warned
him again in a manner that meant business.</p>

<p>“Robbery!” muttered the captain of the Stars, as
he walked back to the bench.</p>

<p>Two were out, and Batch, the pitcher of the home
team, was the next hitter. It happened that Merry
had discovered Batch’s weak point, and he did not
fear him, for which reason he did not again use the
double-shoot in that inning.</p>

<p>A sharp drop caught Batch the first time. Then
followed one close to the batter’s hands, and he hit
it on the handle of the bat. The ball rolled out to
Frank, who threw Batch out at first while Jack was
racing home.</p>

<p>The home team had not scored in that inning, but
they were still two ahead of the visitors, who had
failed to make a single tally.</p>

<p>Hodge met Frank as he came in.</p>

<p>“How is the wrist?” asked Bart anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“Bad,” confessed Merry; “but don’t you say a word
about it.”</p>

<p>“What made you use the double?”</p>

<p>“Had to do something to get out of that hole.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s all right. We’re going to win this game&mdash;if
we can.”</p>

<p>“It will take some scores to do it, and the weak
end comes up this time. We’ve got only one more
chance after this.”</p>

<p>Swiftwing was the first batter. As a rule, the Indian
hit well, but had not secured a safe one thus
far in the game. The former Carlisle man now seized
a bat and advanced to the plate, his manner betraying
determination to do something. Frank spoke to him,
saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t try to kill the ball, John. A single is good
enough, if you can’t get a bag on balls. But wait&mdash;wait.”</p>

<p>Merry had found the Indian a poor waiter, and
this case was no exception. John was so eager to
get a hit that he fell an easy victim to the artifices of
Batch, finally popping up a little fly, which was taken
by the third-baseman of the Stars.</p>

<p>Rattleton’s heart was in his boots when he advanced
to the plate, but he pretended to brace up.
Batch worked the corners, and Harry bit at two bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
ones. Then, in sheer despair, Rattleton slashed at a
high one that was over his head, and hit it!</p>

<p>The ball was driven on a line between short and
second, and Harry raced down to first. If he had
been contented with that, all would have been well;
but he tried to stretch a single into a two-bagger,
and O’Grady, the left-fielder, who had secured the
ball, threw to second.</p>

<p>When it was too late, Harry saw he could not
reach second, and he tried to turn back. Then he
was caught between bases.</p>

<p>“That’s what loses the game!” groaned Hodge, as
he saw the opposing players get on the base-line to
run Rattleton down.</p>

<p>Rattleton did his best to escape, while the players
skilfully forced him back toward first, and then
pinned him so that he could not dodge them. He
was tagged with the ball, and the second man was
out.</p>

<p>The crowd was delighted. They had expected a
hot game, and they were getting their money’s
worth.</p>

<p>Frank’s team had been well advertised in Omaha,
the papers telling of its successful career through
the Rocky Mountain region. Thus far not a single
defeat had been chalked against the Merries; but
now it began to seem that the long string of victories
would be broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>“La! la!” sighed Jack Ready. “How foolish it is
for a man to try to do more than he is capable of accomplishing!”</p>

<p>Then he pretended to wipe a tear from his eye as
Rattleton, looking very cheap and disgusted, came
in to the bench.</p>

<p>“Somebody please kick me!” mumbled Harry.</p>

<p>“With great satisfaction!” exclaimed Jack, and he
proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” murmured Rattleton, as he sat down.</p>

<p>Frank said nothing to Harry, for he knew the unlucky
chap felt bad enough about what he had done,
and Merry had learned by experience that it did little
good with a young team to “call down” the players
or “chew the rag” with them on the field.</p>

<p>Old stagers will take a call-down, but it takes the
spirit out of youngsters, sometimes making them sullen
and sulky. A young ball-player needs encouragement
at all times, criticism often, but public call-downs
never. The captain or manager who is continually
yelling at his players on the field and telling
them how bad they are doing, causes them to lose
five games where he drives them to win one.</p>

<p>Carker was the next man up, and Frank admonished
him to wait for the good ones. Greg was
beaten already, and his appearance showed it. Batch
was full of confidence, and he put the balls right over.</p>

<p>Some batters have a faculty of working a pitcher,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
often getting first base on balls; but the fellow who
does this is usually a good hitter, or he stands up to
the plate, as if he was anxious to “line it out.” When
a pitcher is satisfied that the batter is longing to hit
he gets wary and declines to put the ball over. On
the other hand, let the pitcher suspect the batter is
trying to get a base on balls, and he does his best to
“cut the plate.”</p>

<p>The first two balls pitched were strikes, yet Carker
swung at neither of them.</p>

<p>“It’s all off!” growled Hodge. “He’s the third
victim.”</p>

<p>Then Batch sent in a wide one, and, knowing there
were two strikes on him, Greg reached for it.</p>

<p>Somehow Carker caught that ball on the end of
his bat and sent it skipping down past the first-baseman,
who made an ineffectual effort to block it.</p>

<p>“Run!” yelled Ready, suddenly rousing up. “Dig,
you duffer! It’s a hit!”</p>

<p>Carker had been amazed by his own success, but
he came out of his “trance” in a moment and hustled
down to first. Gamp was there, and he made Carker
stick to the bag.</p>

<p>Merriwell grasped a bat and stepped up to the
plate. Batch was afraid of Merry, for he knew Frank
was a good hitter, and he started in to try to “pull”
the batter.</p>

<p>Apparently Frank was ready and anxious to “lace”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the first good one, but his judgment seemed good,
as he let the first two pass, and both were called
balls.</p>

<p>Batch was holding Carker close to first. As Hanson,
the catcher of the Stars, was a good thrower,
there seemed little chance for Greg to steal second.</p>

<p>The third ball was pretty high, and Merry took a
chance on it by failing to swing. A strike was called.
Frank simply shook his head, thus expressing his belief
that the decision was not correct.</p>

<p>The next ball was a drop, and it seemed too low,
so Merry let that pass. Another ball was called.</p>

<p>“Got him!” chirped Ready. “Oh, ye Grecian gods!
smile upon us now. Be quiet, my good people, and
watch us turn the trick. We are due to do it.”</p>

<p>Batch settled himself for business, and whistled a
speedy one to go straight over the rubber. It didn’t
get over, however, for Frank met it “on the nose.”</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">TAKING THE LEAD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At the crack of the bat, as it seemed, Merry started
to run. The ball went out on a line toward right field,
and Carker dashed for second. The right-fielder
made a jump to get in front of the ball, but it went
past him and struck the ground ten feet beyond.</p>

<p>Away into right field bounded the ball, while
Carker and Merry tore round the bases. As Carker
approached third, he saw Carson wildly motioning
for him to go home.</p>

<p>Greg did not look round, but, had he done so, he
would have seen Merry coming after him with the
speed of the wind. Frank was overhauling Greg in
a most amazing manner.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, the hit into right
field would have been a fair three-bagger; but Merry
covered ground so fast that Carson took a chance in
sending him home.</p>

<p>As Carker approached the plate, Frank Merriwell
was not twenty feet behind him. The fielder had secured
the ball and thrown it to the first-baseman, who
ran out to take it.</p>

<p>Then the baseman whirled and lined the ball to the
plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Carker did not slide, but he barely went over the
plate ahead of the ball. Frank, however, threw himself
forward in a long headlong slide.</p>

<p>Hanson took the ball and touched Merry, but Frank
was lying with his hand on the plate.</p>

<p>“Safe!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>Frank had stretched a three-bagger into a home
run, and the score was tied.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, a great change had come over the
game.</p>

<p>“It’s all over, boys!” laughed Ready. “We can’t
help winning now! It’s another scalp for us!”</p>

<p>“That’s Frank Merriwell!” cried an excited boy on
the bleachers. “You can’t beat him! The whole
world can’t beat him!”</p>

<p>Batch was sore. A short time before he had been
smiling, but now there was no smile on his face. He
looked serious enough as Ready came up. Jack was
determined to “keep the ball rolling,” and he got a
nice hit off the second ball pitched.</p>

<p>Among the spectators were two men who were
watching the game with deep interest. One man was
stout and red-faced, with a stubby mustache, while
the other was slender and dark, wearing a suit of
blue. The stout man choked and gurgled when the
umpire declared Merry safe at the plate.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” he snarled. “He was out by a foot!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Hazen,” said the other man.</p>

<p>“Why, what ails you?” gurgled the portly man.
“Do you want to see us lose this game, Wescott?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered Wescott. “It means something
to me. I have over two hundred dollars bet on
the Stars.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred!” exploded Hazen. “I have almost
a thousand! I spent half of last night hunting bets,
and I took everything I could get at any odds.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man in blue, “I’m afraid we’re in
a bad box. This fellow Merriwell is lucky. He has
a way of winning at anything and everything.”</p>

<p>“But those kids can’t beat our boys!”</p>

<p>“They may. The score is tied.”</p>

<p>“How in blazes can you take it so easy?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use to fret? It won’t win the game.”</p>

<p>“Fret! fret! If you had staked as much as I have,
you’d not be so cool.”</p>

<p>“You can afford to lose a thousand as well as I can
two hundred. You made three thousand on the Ryan-Cummings
fight.”</p>

<p>“That was a sure thing. I was tipped off the way
that mill was going.”</p>

<p>“And you thought this a sure thing to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why not? Those chaps are a lot of boys.
The Stars are veterans.”</p>

<p>“But that lot of boys have the best man for a cap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>tain
who stands in shoe-leather to-day. He makes
them win games&mdash;when he can’t win them alone.”</p>

<p>“He can’t make them win all the time.”</p>

<p>“He does. He hasn’t been pitching at his usual
standard to-day. He had to open up in the last inning,
and he will in the next. See if he doesn’t shut
the Stars out.”</p>

<p>Carson was in position to strike. Batch tried all
the tricks he knew, but Berlin waited till three balls
had been called.</p>

<p>Then a sign passed between Jack and Berlin for
the former to go down on the next ball pitched.</p>

<p>The ball was right over, and Carson swung at it,
missing intentionally. At the same time he seemed
to lose his footing and fall back against the catcher.
The trick was done so well that Carson’s own friends
did not know it was intentional, and he bothered the
catcher long enough for Ready to reach second safely
ahead of the throw to catch him.</p>

<p>Carson did not lose his head, but he was patient,
which resulted in a base on balls.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge advanced to the plate.</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” cried Ready, as he danced about
close to second. “He’ll hit it a mile!”</p>

<p>Batch caught Bart on a drop at the very start,
Hodge missing the ball by several inches.</p>

<p>“Get under it!” called Ready. “If you let him
strike you out, I’ll drop dead right here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>The next one was a ball, but Bart hit the third
one, making a clean single, on which Ready scored
from second. Merriwell’s team had the lead for the
first time during the game.</p>

<p>“You’ve lost your money, Hazen,” said Wescott.</p>

<p>But Hazen had suddenly started from the bleachers,
jumped over the rail, and was moving toward the
bench occupied by the visitors.</p>

<p>“What the dickens is he up to?” muttered Wescott,
in surprise.</p>

<p>Frank felt a hand touch his arm, and, looking
round, found the red-faced man at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars if you let them hit you in the next
inning!” breathed Hazen huskily. “Throw the game
and the money is yours!”</p>

<p>Merry felt his face turn red.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Will you do it?” panted Hazen.</p>

<p>“Where is an officer?” demanded Frank. “I want
this man put out.”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars!” came from the gambler.</p>

<p>“Get out!” Frank sternly commanded. “You can’t
buy me!”</p>

<p>“Two hundred!” bid Hazen. “Don’t be a fool!
I am good for it! Here! Shake hands with me!”</p>

<p>He suddenly grasped Frank’s hand, into which he
pressed something. When Merry looked, he was as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>tonished
to see the man had left a wad of bills in
his hand.</p>

<p>Instantly Frank flung the money in the man’s face,
speaking in a low, hard tone:</p>

<p>“You’ve made a big mistake! Take your dirty
money and get out of this lively!”</p>

<p>Hazen’s face became redder than ever. Seeing he
was exposed, he immediately said:</p>

<p>“I want you to stand by your word! You said
you’d sell the game for two hundred dollars if you
got ahead; now you can’t back out, for I hold you to
the agreement.”</p>

<p>Merry saw through the trick, and he turned pale,
while a strange laugh broke from his lips.</p>

<p>“You’re a big bluffer, but I don’t think you’ll fool
anybody. It will take more than two hundred dollars
to buy me.”</p>

<p>The man had picked up his money.</p>

<p>“Then you’re a liar!” he said; “for you made a
fair and square agreement with me.”</p>

<p>“You are the one who lies!” Merry asserted. “I
never saw you before.”</p>

<p>“You’re a cheap chap to go back on your word.”</p>

<p>This was something more than Frank could stand,
and he had the stout man by the collar in a moment.</p>

<p>“Swallow your words!” he said, as he gave the man
a shake. “Take them back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“Never! It’s true!”</p>

<p>Then Frank Merriwell gave that corpulent party
such a shaking that it took the wind out of Hazen and
made him limp as a rag.</p>

<p>“Sus-sus-stop it!” he spluttered. “How dare you
lay hands on me?”</p>

<p>“How dare you offer me money to throw this
game!” exclaimed Merry indignantly. “What you
need is a first-class thrashing!”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” roared the crowd. “Give it to
him, Merriwell!”</p>

<p>An officer appeared, and Hazen was ordered back
to the bleachers. He retired, his face purple with
anger, while he muttered beneath his breath.</p>

<p>This little incident seemed to turn the sympathy
of a great portion of the audience toward Merriwell.
Somebody shouted:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>The crowd thundered:</p>

<p>“He’s all right!”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire impatiently.</p>

<p>Hazen resumed his seat beside Wescott, who said:</p>

<p>“Well, you made an exhibition of yourself! What
good did it do you?”</p>

<p>“That fellow is a fool!” growled the stout man.</p>

<p>“You might have known you could not buy him.”</p>

<p>“Every man has his price.”</p>

<p>“Not Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe he is an exception.”</p>

<p>“You found him so.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t offer him enough.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because there is another way to get this game.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I know Derring, the umpire.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He has seen me.”</p>

<p>“What of that?”</p>

<p>“He’s looking this way now.”</p>

<p>Then Hazen suddenly held up his hand and made
a peculiar sign. It was impossible to tell whether
Derring saw and understood or not.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked Wescott.</p>

<p>“Making my last bid for this game,” declared the
corpulent man.</p>

<p>“Well, you must have nerve!” exclaimed Wescott.
“That fellow can’t throw the game now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but we’ll see. Look at that. Ha!”</p>

<p>Gamp was the batter, and at this juncture the umpire
called a strike on him that was over his head.</p>

<p>“Do you think he did that intentionally?” whispered
Wescott, as the crowd roared in derision.</p>

<p>“Wait,” was the only thing Hazen would say.</p>

<p>The next ball was wide of the plate, but again a
strike was called by the umpire.</p>

<p>“Sus-sus-sus-say!” stuttered Joe, “dud-dud-dud-don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
you want me to lend ye a pup-pup-pup-pair of
glasses?”</p>

<p>The next ball was so low that the catcher almost
picked it up off the ground, but the umpire loudly announced:</p>

<p>“Batter is out!”</p>

<p>“Rank!” howled a voice.</p>

<p>“Bum!” yelled another.</p>

<p>“Awful! awful!” shrieked a shrill-voiced man.</p>

<p>Then the crowd took it up and jeered at the umpire.</p>

<p>“By George!” exclaimed Wescott, laughing, “I believe
the fellow has taken you at your offer, Hazen!”</p>

<p>The corpulent gambler drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“I hope he has,” he said. “There’s a bare show
that the Stars will win out.”</p>

<p>Gamp made the third one out, and the home team
came in from the field.</p>

<p>Merry went out and protested to the umpire, but
his protest did no good.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to hold them down, fellows,” said
Frank. “It’s the only way to win out.”</p>

<p>His arm, however, was feeling bad, and he was
fearful that he might find great trouble in remaining
in the box to the end.</p>

<p>Teller headed the list for the home team, and he
was the first man up. Frank gave him the first one
right over the heart of the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“One ball!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Frank looked at the man.</p>

<p>“Did I understand you?” he asked. “Did you call
that a ball?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get fresh, young man!” growled the umpire.
“You know it was a ball!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it go straight over the heart of the plate?”</p>

<p>“It was a ball! I called it that, and it has to stand.”</p>

<p>The crowd showed its disgust by uttering cries of
derision, and shouting scornfully at the umpire.
Merry put another over, but this time he used a
drop.</p>

<p>“Two balls!”</p>

<p>“Outrage!” snarled Hodge. “Hit him, Merry!”</p>

<p>Teller realized that something had happened, and
he refused to strike at either of the next two pitched,
though both were on the outside corner. The umpire
sent him to first.</p>

<p>Then came Skew, who swung at the ball as Teller
went down to second for a steal.</p>

<p>For once, Hodge threw a bit wild, but Rattleton
got the ball and jumped for the man, who slid. Teller
was tagged while two feet off the base.</p>

<p>“Safe at second!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“What is this?” yelled a man on the bleachers.
“We came here to see a game of ball. This is a regular
roast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>The work of the umpire was turning the crowd
against the home team.</p>

<p>Skew hit the next ball pitched. It went straight
at Ready, who gathered it up and saw it would be an
easy thing to catch the runner with a good throw.
Jack sent the ball whistling across the diamond, and
Browning had it three seconds before the runner
passed over first.</p>

<p>“Safe!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>Frank tried to convince the umpire that the decision
was wrong, but found he was wasting his breath
in talk.</p>

<p>O’Grady came up. Thinking he might wait to get
his base on balls, Merry ventured one on the corner.</p>

<p>O’Grady hit it hard.</p>

<p>“That ties the score!” cried many.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">AN ANGRY MOB.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The ball went out to Swiftwing, who was compelled
to run hard, coming straight in. It seemed that the
ball would strike the ground before the redskin could
get his hands on it, but John sprinted hard and made
a forward dive as he ran.</p>

<p>The ball struck in the hands of the fielder when it
was not over six inches from the ground. Swiftwing
held it.</p>

<p>Teller and Skew were racing round the bases, having
been coached to go along. Teller had reached
third and was going home, while Skew had passed
over to second.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to head off Skew by throwing to
third, Swiftwing threw to second. Rattleton took
the throw, while Skew reached third. Then Rattleton
threw to first.</p>

<p>Frank called the umpire and asked him to announce
the batter and two runners ahead of him out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” demanded the umpire,
as if greatly amazed. “There is nobody out.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Merry, astounded. “Why, the
three men are out, and you know it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me how?”</p>

<p>“O’Grady is out on Swiftwing’s catch of his long
drive, and the other men are out for having been
caught off their bases on a ball that was caught before
it touched the ground.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried the umpire, “whom do you take
me for? I know something about this game, and
I have a good pair of eyes. Your Indian didn’t catch
that ball.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because he picked it up just after it struck the
ground. I saw him do it.”</p>

<p>The words of the umpire caused great excitement
on Merriwell’s team; but the players kept away and
let Frank settle the matter, having been taught to
do so.</p>

<p>The crowd had quieted down enough to hear something
of what was being said, and great surprise was
manifested by the decision.</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage!” exclaimed more than one.</p>

<p>The spectators were angry. A short time before
they had been roaring and “rooting” for the home
team, but the rank work of the umpire had turned
all their sympathy to Merriwell’s team.</p>

<p>“That man is out on first!” shouted an excited
spectator, as he stood up and made furious gestures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“He’s out! he’s out!”</p>

<p>“Both of those runners are out!” yelled another
man. “They ran on a fly ball that was caught. Come
in, Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Then the crowd began to yell:</p>

<p>“Out! out! out!”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” snarled the umpire. “I have given my
decision!”</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to change it,” asserted Frank.</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“You know you are wrong, and everybody in that
crowd knows it. You have turned the crowd against
you by your work.”</p>

<p>“You shut up and play ball!” came savagely from
the umpire. “If you don’t, I’ll declare the game forfeited.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and declare it,” said Merry. “You cannot
drive us that way.”</p>

<p>“Will you play ball, or not?”</p>

<p>“Put that umpire out!” roared the crowd. “He’s
robbing you, Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“Hear that,” said Frank. “You can see what is
thought of your work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!”</p>

<p>“Then your decision stands?”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“Come in, boys!” cried Merry. “We go to bat or
leave the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>He made a gesture, and every man came trotting
in from the field.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried the crowd. “That’s the talk!
That’s right! that’s right!”</p>

<p>Then they cheered loudly.</p>

<p>The captain of the Stars ran out to the umpire, but
Frank gave that individual no further attention.
When the shouting lulled, the umpire loudly cried:</p>

<p>“I will give Merriwell just one minute to put his
men back on the field. If he does not do it in that
time I shall declare the game in favor of the Omaha
Stars.”</p>

<p>“You’re a thundering big stiff!” bellowed a man on
the bleachers.</p>

<p>“He’s a robber&mdash;that’s what he is!” cried another
man shrilly.</p>

<p>“Robber! robber! robber!” shrilled a lot of small
boys.</p>

<p>“I propose we give him what he deserves!” came
from the man with the hoarse voice. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Over the rail he leaped, and then there was an upheaval
of the angry multitude, men following the
leader like a flock of sheep. On to the diamond
rushed a mad mob that quickly surrounded the umpire.</p>

<p>Now, that umpire had not expected anything of
the sort and he was frightened, for he saw he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
in danger of rough treatment. He could not get
away, and heavy hands were placed upon him.</p>

<p>“Thump him!”</p>

<p>“Kick him!”</p>

<p>“Tar and feather him!”</p>

<p>“Black his eyes!”</p>

<p>“Soak him!”</p>

<p>The man was in danger of being treated roughly.</p>

<p>Into that angry mob plunged Frank Merriwell,
flung men aside, and forced his way to the side of the
cheating umpire.</p>

<p>“Stop!” rang out Frank’s clear voice, as he faced
the furious mob. “This is what kills baseball!”</p>

<p>“An umpire like that kills it!”</p>

<p>“Kill the umpire!”</p>

<p>“He ought to be lynched!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he ought to be lynched,” said Merry; “but
we didn’t come here to take part in this kind of a
game, and I don’t believe Mr. Dorrity, captain of the
Stars, wants to steal this game from us. We play
honest baseball, or not at all. All we ask of anybody
is what we deserve.”</p>

<p>“You’re not getting it from this whelp!”</p>

<p>“I know we are not, but I don’t want this game to
end in a riot, and you shall not mob the umpire.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do it, anyhow! He deserves it!” came from
one man.</p>

<p>Frank’s team had been forcing its way to Merry’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
side, and now, at a sign, they closed round him and
infolded the treacherous umpire.</p>

<p>“We are not anxious enough for this game to
have it go out that the umpire was mobbed,” said
Merry. “We shall protect him.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” exclaimed the
hoarse-voiced man.</p>

<p>“This Merriwell takes the cake!” said another man.
“Instead of protecting that cheat, I’d hit him over
the head with a club, if I were Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“The roaster ought to be soaked with a bat!”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let him rob you of the game,
Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Mr. Dorrity will do that,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>Dorrity had been trying to reach the umpire, and
he finally succeeded.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to change that decision, Derring,”
he said. “The crowd won’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>“I gave it just as I saw it,” said Derring. “I can’t
change it.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to put in another umpire.”</p>

<p>“You have no right to put me out. An umpire is
in for a game.”</p>

<p>“Not if he’s a barefaced robber!” cried somebody.
“Put him out!”</p>

<p>“Put him out! put him out!” roared the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Where is Chop Morrisy?” cried the captain of the
Stars.</p>

<p>“Here,” answered a voice.</p>

<p>“Morrisy, we’ll have to ask you to finish umpiring
this game. Won’t you do it for us?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not.”</p>

<p>“But you will?”</p>

<p>Morrisy hesitated, but finally consented.</p>

<p>“Get out, Derring!” cried the crowd. “Go off and
die! Go bag your head!”</p>

<p>Derring was fierce, and he snarled:</p>

<p>“I declare the game forfeited to the Omaha Stars
by a score of nine to nothing!”</p>

<p>“And we refuse to accept the forfeit,” said Dorrity
promptly. “You are no longer umpire, so you cannot
declare it.”</p>

<p>“Off the field with him, boys,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Packed close about Derring, Merry’s men pushed
through the mob and hustled the cheating rascal off to
the bleachers. As he climbed over the rail the mob
howled in derision at him.</p>

<p>Then the field was cleared, and Dorrity announced
that the game would go on.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">BEATEN AT LAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“How are we going to settle Derring’s last decision?”
asked Frank. “All three men were out on
the play, as you know, Dorrity.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the captain of the Stars. “In
fact, I did not see the catch, as I was urging the man
to run. I thought the Indian could not catch the
ball.”</p>

<p>“But the crowd saw him do it.”</p>

<p>“Some of my men say it looked like a pick-up.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll put Teller and Skew back on second
and first and let O’Grady bat over. That’s fair.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because they are out.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve given in a point and changed the umpire.”</p>

<p>“I have permitted you to put in anybody you chose
as umpire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Merriwell, meet me half-way in this.”</p>

<p>“And give you all the advantage? I am not playing
ball that way to-day, Mr. Dorrity. As I have be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>fore
stated, all I want is my due; but that is what I
will have if there is any way to get it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to refuse to play if those three men
are not called out?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, the umpire will forfeit the game to us.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever yield a point?”</p>

<p>“Not in this kind of a game, if I know I am right.”</p>

<p>Dorrity found he could not budge Merriwell, and he
reluctantly ordered his men back on the field. The
score stood three to two in favor of Frank’s team.
But the home team came last to bat.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the ninth. Browning was
the first man up for Merry’s team, and the big fellow
advanced heavily to the plate, resolved to start things
moving once more. Batch had sized up Browning,
and he kept the balls high and close.</p>

<p>Two strikes and two balls were called. Then
Bruce popped up an easy one, which was smothered
in the first-baseman’s big mitt.</p>

<p>It was a bad start on the ninth. Swiftwing remembered
his last turn at bat, and he now did his best
to get a hit. He was fortunate enough to meet the
ball and drop it over the infield for a safety.</p>

<p>But Rattleton fanned, and two were out. Carker
had braced up wonderfully since Merriwell was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
lead, and he went after the ball in very pretty style,
picking out the good ones and fouling several.</p>

<p>Two strikes were called on him, and then he met
the ball fairly, sending it flying into the outfield. Maloney,
the right-fielder, ran for the ball, although it
was really in center-field territory.</p>

<p>“Teller! Teller!” cried Dorrity loudly.</p>

<p>But it seemed that Maloney did not hear, for he
kept after the ball. The fielders collided and both
went down. The ball had struck in the hands of Teller,
but Maloney sprang up at once and held it aloft.</p>

<p>“Batter out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>“Robber! robber!” cried many. “Teller dropped
the ball and Maloney picked it up!”</p>

<p>Frank “kicked” against the decision, but Morrisy
stuck to it. Merry had seen the ball strike in Teller’s
hands, and he had not seen it pass to the hands of
Maloney. The affair was rather singular, yet he
could not say he had seen Teller drop the ball. Such
being the case, he was compelled to abide by the decision
of the umpire. That retired the side, with the
score unchanged.</p>

<p>“We must get together and hold the enemy prostrate,”
said Ready. “It’s the way to win this game.”</p>

<p>Frank went into the box. Hodge knew Merry
would start with the double-shoot, meaning to strike
out the first batter up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Hanson, of the home team, stepped up to the plate.
Frank gave him a dazzler, and Hanson fanned.</p>

<p>But again that pain shot the whole length of Frank’s
arm, and it felt as if something had broken.</p>

<p>“Guess some of the glass cracked,” thought Frank.</p>

<p>When Bart returned the ball, Merry took plenty of
time in delivering it again. Then he tried the double-shoot
once more, but threw the sphere high over
Bart’s head.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Hodge, instantly comprehending
that all was not right.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head, but he threw no more double
curves. He passed a high one up to Hanson, who hit
it into the diamond. Browning tried to field the ball,
but it got through him, and Hanson reached the bag.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p>The coacher warned Hanson to play safe, and Jack,
the second-baseman of the Stars, advanced to the
plate. Using such skill as he could command with his
bad arm, Merry struck Jack out. Hanson had been
forced to cling to first.</p>

<p>Maloney followed as a batter. On the first ball
pitched Hanson started for second. Maloney slashed
at the ball with a wide swing that was intended to
baffle Hodge in his throw to second.</p>

<p>Bart put the ball down like a bullet. Hanson was
coming fast, and he slid feet first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>It is possible that Rattleton thought of Hanson’s
spikes, for he changed his position and muffed the
ball. Hanson slid under and was safe.</p>

<p>“Hard luck, Harry!” exclaimed Frank. “You had
him if you’d held it!”</p>

<p>“Somebody ought to shoot me!” muttered Rattleton,
his face red as a beet.</p>

<p>Frank gave Maloney one close to his hands, and
the batter hit it down to Ready. Jack picked the ball
up and turned to see where Hanson was. Hanson
was about three yards off second, so Ready sent the
ball across the diamond to first. The instant Ready
threw, Hanson streaked it for third.</p>

<p>Maloney could run like a deer, and he beat the
throw to first.</p>

<p>Browning did not wait for a decision, but sent the
ball back to Ready, who, seeing Hanson coming, had
leaped to cover third. The throw was not accurate,
and Jack was pulled off third about two feet, which
was enough to save Hanson, who slid round behind
him and was safe.</p>

<p>The Stars were fighting for the game. It looked
rather dangerous now, but Frank did not let that
worry him. Had his wrist been in good condition, he
would have found a way to stop the run-getting in
short order. But he could not use the double-shoot,
and so was compelled to rely on his support when
the opposing batters hit him hard. And his support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
had not been of the first class, except during the first
of the game.</p>

<p>Corrigan was a good waiter, but Merry started in
to compel him to hit. Maloney went down to second
on the first ball pitched.</p>

<p>Hodge threw like a bullet for second. Carson cut
in as if intending to take the throw, and this kept
Hanson from trying to score.</p>

<p>Seeing Hanson did not try to go home, Carson let
the ball pass, and Rattleton caught it, putting it on to
Maloney.</p>

<p>“Out at second!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>This was team-work. Had Hanson started for
home, Carson would have caught the ball and driven
it straight to the plate to cut him off there. The opposing
team had fancied Carson meant to take the
ball, anyhow, which is an old trick. In this they had
been fooled completely.</p>

<p>Two men were out. Another out without a score
would give the game to Merriwell.</p>

<p>Corrigan looked anxious, and Frank tried to work
him for a strike-out. Merry got himself into a bad
hole, and was compelled to put the ball over. Corrigan
hit it fairly and drove it out.</p>

<p>As two men were out already, Hanson did not
pause at third, but came home immediately. Swiftwing
was forced to make a hard run, and then, as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
to offset his former brilliant catch, he muffed the
ball.</p>

<p>The score was tied. Corrigan was on first. Dorrity
ran in from the coaching-lines and got a bat.</p>

<p>“Score on my hit!” he cried.</p>

<p>Frank gave him a drop, and he let it pass. Then
Merry tried a high one, and Dorrity drove it along
the ground. The ball went to Carson, struck Berlin’s
feet, and flew away off to one side. Ready raced
for it, got it, and, in spite of Frank’s warning cry,
overthrew to first.</p>

<p>Corrigan came on to third while Browning was
after the ball. Bruce got it, and fancied he could
nail Corrigan before the runner could make third. In
his great haste he threw wild, also, which let Corrigan
come home with the winning run.</p>

<p>Merriwell was defeated. And the defeat was due
mainly to the ragged support given him by his team.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">FRANK’S CHALLENGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“My poor heart is broken!” sighed Jack Ready, as
Merriwell’s team gathered in Frank’s room at one of
the leading hotels in the city. “Alas and alack!”</p>

<p>“It was ‘alack’ of something, else we’d won,” said
Merry.</p>

<p>“A lack of ball-playing,” growled Hodge. “We
played like a lot of wood-choppers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bart, how can you say so?” exclaimed Ready.
“We didn’t make more than fifteen or twenty errors
and bad plays.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t my throw to third a bird?” grunted
Browning, who was stretched on a comfortable couch.</p>

<p>“It was a match to my throw to first,” said Jack.
“They made a beautiful pair of birds.”</p>

<p>“And to think we have met defeat at last!” moaned
Greg Carker. “But it is ever thus. Now we can
see how others feel when we beat them. This strife
for the mastery in this world is a monstrous evil.
We see it every day, and it makes brutes and monsters
of mankind. The time will come when such
strife will cease and perfect harmony will exist; but
never can this harmony be known until there has
been a great social upheaval&mdash;never until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Here comes the earthquake!” cried several of the
party.</p>

<p>Greg looked pained.</p>

<p>“Some day the earthquake will come,” he said, “and
you, like thousands of others, will be entirely unprepared
for it.”</p>

<p>“It was a gug-gug-gol-ding shame to lose that
game!” stuttered Gamp. “We had it all nun-nun-nailed
down once.”</p>

<p>“I was in poor condition to pitch to-day,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” disputed Ready. “It was not that,
gentle captain. The team was in poor condition to
support any kind of a pitcher. It was one of our
ragged days.”</p>

<p>“But I could not use the double-shoot as much as
I ought.”</p>

<p>“You can’t play the whole game alone,” muttered
Hodge.</p>

<p>“Methinks he has more than once,” said Ready.</p>

<p>“I helped lose the game,” sighed Rattleton. “I
feel like hagging my bed&mdash;I mean bagging my head!”</p>

<p>“These people will crow over us here,” growled
Browning.</p>

<p>“I fancy some spondulicks changed hands on the
result of that game,” observed Ready. “The wicked
gamester is abroad in the land, and he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Tried to buy Merry off,” finished Hodge. “The
whelp did buy the umpire.”</p>

<p>“But we cast that umpire forth, and his influence
was felt no longer upon us,” put in Ready. “We
can’t lay the blame on the umpire.”</p>

<p>“I won’t get over this in a month!” muttered
Hodge bitterly. “It was a hard game to lose.”</p>

<p>“Lul-lul-let’s challenge them to another gug-game!”
cried Gamp. “We can dud-dud-do ’em next time!”</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Frank, “we lost the mascot of the
nine, and that’s what ailed us to-day. We played a
bad game, but it might have been different if Dick
had been with us.”</p>

<p>“Dick was a mascot,” agreed Browning. “Why,
that little wizard can pitch ball like a veteran.”</p>

<p>“And Old Joe Crowfoot,” said Frank; “he was not
with us. If he had been on hand to powwow round
the home plate before the game, he might have put
something into the team that seemed lacking.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose we’ll ever see that old varmint
again?” said Jack questioningly.</p>

<p>“I think we shall,” nodded Merry. “He’s recovering
from the wound he received, and I do not believe
he will leave Dick when he gets well.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to bother with that soiled old scarecrow?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“For Dick’s sake, I shall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“He’s made you no end of trouble,” declared Hodge.
“It was he who induced Dick to rebel.”</p>

<p>“But he has learned his lesson. I saw that he was
placed where he could have the very best care and
nursing, and I left Dick with him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t expect gratitude from an onery redskin,”
said Bart.</p>

<p>Then he looked round quickly and gave a breath
of relief on discovering that Swiftwing was not in
the room.</p>

<p>“I confess,” said Frank, “that Old Joe’s skin seemed
chock full of peskiness, but he has taught Dick many
things that no white man could. If I can get the
false notions out of the boy’s head, he will be a perfect
wonder in time.”</p>

<p>It was only after the death of Frank Merriwell’s
father in the West that Merry had learned that he
had a half-brother. In his will Mr. Merriwell imposed
upon Frank the care of Dick, who had been
brought up in the wilds of the West, in the care of
Juan Delores, a Spanish refugee. The boy’s constant
companion and mentor had been an old Indian, known
as Joe Crowfoot. It had been with great difficulty
that Frank had forced his young brother to accept
him as his guardian, and the boy’s rebellion against
Frank’s plans to remove him from his wild life had
been encouraged by the old Indian, who loved the wild
boy as he would have loved a son. Merry’s powerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
will, however, had finally won both the boy and the
Indian to him.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do with Dick?” questioned
Carson. “Will you send him to Yale?”</p>

<p>“I hope to; but first he will have to put in some
years at school.”</p>

<p>“Where will you send him to school?”</p>

<p>“At Fardale.”</p>

<p>“That’s the place!” nodded Hodge. “He’ll get
some of the kinks taken out of him there.”</p>

<p>“One thing fills me with extreme sadness,” said
Ready. “That is that the first umpire did not receive
his medicine from the crowd to-day.”</p>

<p>“That crowd was rooting for us before the game
finished,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“And they seemed to feel bad because we lost,” said
Rattleton. “We made some friends.”</p>

<p>“For the love of goodness, Merry!” exploded
Ready; “is there no way we can get square? Can’t
we tackle those fellows again and wipe up the earth
with them?”</p>

<p>“If Dick were here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We won games before we knew anything about
Dick.”</p>

<p>But, strange to say, Frank seemed to feel that the
presence of his young brother was needed in order
for them to win.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to talk about it any more,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Carson. “I am going to get out of this hotel and take
a walk.”</p>

<p>The others seemed to feel like doing something of
the sort, and they left the room in a body, descending
to the office of the hotel, where Frank called for
their mail. There happened to be letters for several
of the party. Merry received one, which he opened
and began to read at once.</p>

<p>As Frank was reading his letter he heard two men
talking near at hand. One of them was saying:</p>

<p>“It would draw a big crowd, and there would be
money in it. Why don’t you get Merriwell’s team
for another game, Wilson?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” said a voice that Frank recognized
as that of the manager of the Stars. “Those
fellows put up the best game they are capable of to-day,
and we’d simply beat them to death next time.
I don’t want to play any poor games, as that will
spoil baseball in this town. The Stars are drawing
well now.”</p>

<p>“I know a man who says he’ll bet five hundred
even that you can’t beat Merriwell again.”</p>

<p>“He’s crazy!”</p>

<p>“No. It’s Livingstone.”</p>

<p>“Why, Hazen will give him two to one.”</p>

<p>“But Hazen has queered himself to-day. The
crowd is onto him. It’s current to-night that he tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to bribe Merriwell, and that, failing in this, he bought
Derring.”</p>

<p>“How could he buy Derring?”</p>

<p>“He made signs to him.”</p>

<p>“Bah! How did Derring know what his signs
meant?”</p>

<p>“I have heard it said that Derring has been bought
before.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe that rot!”</p>

<p>“Well, I know that he made some terrible decisions,
and he would have been mobbed if Merriwell hadn’t
protected him.”</p>

<p>“He’s stubborn, and he would not give in&mdash;that’s
all. I don’t think he really meant to rob the other
team.”</p>

<p>“The crowd thought so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I doubt if Merriwell would dare play us
again, even if we offered him a game.”</p>

<p>“That is where you make a mistake, Mr. Wilson.”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell was the speaker, and he stepped
forward, having crushed in his hand the letter he had
been reading.</p>

<p>“Merriwell!” exclaimed Wilson.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Merry. “I happened to hear some
of your conversation just now. I trust you will pardon
me, but I was curious when you spoke my name.
You have said that I would fear to meet your team
again. You are wrong. Not only am I not afraid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
but I now challenge you to play us another game day
after to-morrow, the winners to take the entire gate-money.
I shall publish my challenge in the morning
papers.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Wilson warmly, “we’ll play you, and
we won’t give you a run. You are due for a shutout,
Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p>Several of Merry’s friends had heard him make
the challenge, and they were eager to know why he
had done so. As they left the hotel, Frank said:</p>

<p>“I have received a letter from Dick.”</p>

<p>“Your brother? What does he say?”</p>

<p>“He’s on his way. He will reach Omaha in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” cried Ready. “Now I understand why
you flung the gauntlet in the teeth of Manager Wilson.
You believe we can do his team, with the aid of
Richard.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Dick is bringing Old Crowfoot along,
and we’ll get into the Stars in great shape.”</p>

<p>“Will you pitch him against these heavy-hitters?”</p>

<p>“I have not decided on that. If my wrist were
right, I’d not think of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it, anyway!” begged Hodge. “Pitch
the game yourself, Merry, and we’ll support you
next time.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we will, most mighty one!” declared
Ready. “We’ll back you up like a stone wall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>Within a short distance of the hotel they came face
to face with Derring, the treacherous umpire. He
was accompanied by Hazen, the gambler.</p>

<p>The moment he saw Merriwell, Derring’s face
flamed, and he uttered an exclamation of anger. He
had been drinking, and he made straight for Frank.</p>

<p>“I want to see you!” he exclaimed. “T believe you
gave the crowd the impression that I was trying to
do something crooked to-day. I have a score to settle
with you.”</p>

<p>Frank looked at the rascal in surprise and contempt.</p>

<p>“You have more nerve than any man I ever saw,”
he declared. “Your work on the field to-day spoke
for itself. I did not have to give the impression.”</p>

<p>“But you did it, just the same. You got the crowd
down on me.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“By kicking against my decision.”</p>

<p>“I kicked because I was not willing to be robbed.”</p>

<p>“Then you say I was robbing you?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“You are a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” rang out Frank’s voice. “Don’t say it!
I protected you from the mob to-day after you did
me a dirty turn, but I’ll not hold my hand in case
you call me a liar!”</p>

<p>“If you lifted a hand on me,” said Derring, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
eyes glaring and his hand moving toward his hip,
“I’d shoot you like a dog!”</p>

<p>“If you were quick enough you might, but I doubt
if you would.”</p>

<p>Bart Hodge was ready to spring at Derring.</p>

<p>“You had better get out of this town!” grated the
umpire. “I give you warning that it isn’t safe for
you to stay here!”</p>

<p>“I do not mind your warnings. I shall stay here
until after the next game with the Stars.”</p>

<p>“The next game?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We play again day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll be pie. Say, Hazen, that will be your
chance to make a stake. Bet all your money on the
Stars. The next game will be a walkover.”</p>

<p>“All of that,” nodded Hazen.</p>

<p>“You thought so to-day, sir,” said Frank; “but at
one time you were so worried that you tried to bribe
me to throw the game. When you failed, you did
bribe Derring.”</p>

<p>“It’s false!”</p>

<p>“It’s true! But we’ll win the next game, for all of
your crooked work and for all of the umpiring.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” chirped Ready. “We’ll win in a walk,
and nothing can stop us. The Stars shall fall, and
great will be the fall thereof.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Frank, to the others; “let’s move on.
I do not care to be seen talking to these men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>That cut both Derring and Hazen.</p>

<p>“Go on!” growled the latter. “I’ll bet my last
dollar you lose.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll be a subject for public charity directly
after the game,” assured Ready.</p>

<p>Frank was about to move along when Derring insolently
blocked his way and shoved against him.
Quick as a flash Merry whirled and grasped the man.
Then he gave the rascal a shake that yanked him
from beneath his hat.</p>

<p>Derring snarled and struck at Merry. Frank’s patience
was exhausted, and he could not hold back
the return blow. His fist caught the man under the
ear, and down to the sidewalk dropped Mr. Derring.</p>

<p>“Police!” cried Hazen; but he reached for his hip
pocket.</p>

<p>“Don’t draw!” warned Merry.</p>

<p>Hazen did not heed. Out came his hand, and it
held a revolver.</p>

<p>Instantly Merry’s foot flew out, and the toe of his
boot struck the hand of the man, sending the revolver
flying into the air.</p>

<p>As the weapon came down Merry caught it, snapped
it open, casting out the cartridges, and politely returned
it to its owner.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said. “Here is your gun.
But I believe it is a dangerous thing for you to have
round. You might shoot somebody with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>Hazen was frothing. Derring struggled up and
reached for his hip.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Hodge.</p>

<p>Frank was on the alert. He leaped on Derring,
twisted his hand from his hip, jerked out the revolver
himself, and sent the weapon flying across the
street.</p>

<p>“Some of you Western people are extremely careless
with your shooting-irons,” he observed. “Come
on, fellows.”</p>

<p>Then, accompanied by his friends, he walked away.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">A BOY OF NERVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Dick Merriwell did arrive in Omaha the following
morning, and he brought Old Joe Crowfoot with him.
The old redskin was looking thin and weak, and the
expression of his wrinkled face was as inscrutable as
ever.</p>

<p>“How!” he exclaimed, holding out his hand to
Merriwell, as Frank met them at the station.</p>

<p>“How are you, Crowfoot?” exclaimed Merry.</p>

<p>“Heap better,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“That is good. Has the wound healed?”</p>

<p>“Some.”</p>

<p>“Are you strong?”</p>

<p>“Not yet; get so heap soon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to see you. I took pains to have
everything done for your comfort and to aid in
bringing you round as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Heap much good!” said the old fellow. “Joe him
not forget.”</p>

<p>“Joe will never forget,” assured Dick. “He has
told me so many times. He thought at first you were
the one who shot him, but now he knows better.
We have talked it all over while he has been getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
stronger, and he has decided that it is best for me
to go with you and do just what you say.”</p>

<p>“Heap so,” nodded Old Joe. “Injun Heart your
brother, Steady Hand. You take him now and make
him your way. Old Joe him done all he can.”</p>

<p>“And Dick owes you much for what you have done.
But where are you going, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Back to mountains&mdash;Joe go by himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Dick. “He won’t promise to
stay with me.”</p>

<p>Frank placed a hand on the arm of the old Indian.</p>

<p>“Crowfoot,” he said earnestly, “I wish you to stay
with Dick. I will take you along, and it shall cost
you nothing.”</p>

<p>“White man’s way not Injun’s way.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but you may do as you please.”</p>

<p>“No good.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I will let no one bother you. I give
you my word, and my word is good. Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Crowfoot him believe Steady Hand.”</p>

<p>“That is all I want. You are old, Joe, and I will
see that you are cared for. I feel it a duty. You
shall have such clothes as you need, a shelter, and
plenty of tobacco.”</p>

<p>“Much good!”</p>

<p>“And you shall see Dick every day. You may be
able to teach him many things more. It is your duty
to him. You are to see that I do not spoil him by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
making him too much like a white man. I am his
brother, but you shall be his father. Will you do
it?”</p>

<p>Old Joe hesitated, looked Frank keenly in the face,
as if seeking to ascertain his sincerity, then said:</p>

<p>“Joe him do it!”</p>

<p>“Then that is settled!” exclaimed Frank, in satisfaction.</p>

<p>“When Joe he want to go him go.”</p>

<p>“You shall go whenever you like.”</p>

<p>Dick was delighted by this arrangement.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Frank!” he exclaimed. “Thank you!
thank you! Now, if I could only have Felicia&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you may.”</p>

<p>Dick’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“How can that be possible?” he asked. “She is far
away.”</p>

<p>“But her father must understand that the time has
come when she should attend school somewhere. Her
mother is dead, and can teach her no longer. Mr.
Delores may instruct her in Spanish, but she should
have a different tutor. I hope to induce her father
to bring her East and put her into school.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Crowfoot. “Him no do it. Him
have heap many enemy. Him stay where him be.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” said Merry. “I am glad you are
here, Dick, for we have missed you on the nine.”</p>

<p>“Missed me?” said the boy, his eyes dancing. “Why,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
you do not really need me on the nine. You simply
played me in order that I might get experience and
practise.”</p>

<p>“Who told you so?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Anyhow, I thought so.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have played a game without you and
lost it. The Stars, of this city, trimmed us yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Dick, in amazement. “How could
they do it?”</p>

<p>“They did it very handsomely.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was square! I don’t believe they
could beat you!”</p>

<p>“They did, Dick.”</p>

<p>“And you pitched?”</p>

<p>“With that.”</p>

<p>Frank held up his wrist, about which there was a
bandage.</p>

<p>“If you had been here, Dick,” he said, “they could
not have won the game.”</p>

<p>This was praise, indeed, and the heart of the boy
glowed. It was fine to know that Frank had so
much confidence in him.</p>

<p>“I am here now,” he said.</p>

<p>“And we play them again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Good! good! We’ll win! You really want me
to play, Frank?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“I want you to play, and I want Old Joe on the
bench. The combination will give us good luck.”</p>

<p>“Old Joe him go to see Dick play. Him great little
boy at um baseball.”</p>

<p>“Then it is all up with the Omaha Stars,” laughed
Frank. “We’ll beat them for sure.”</p>

<p>There was a burst of coarse, sarcastic laughter
near at hand, and Frank turned quickly, to see Hazen
and Derring there. He looked at the men intently,
and they returned his stare in a most insolent manner.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Hazen?” laughed Jim
Derring. “Merriwell thinks he’ll be able to win the
game just because he has that kid to put on the team.”</p>

<p>“I think Merriwell is an idiot,” rumbled Hazen.</p>

<p>A flash of fire came into Dick Merriwell’s dark eyes,
and he sprang toward the men.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he cried. “What do you know
about baseball?”</p>

<p>“I knew all about the game before you was born,
kid,” said the treacherous umpire.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t know enough to be a gentleman!”
flashed Dick, in his fearless manner.</p>

<p>“What’s that? Why, you little runt, I’ll shake you
outer them clothes!”</p>

<p>“Try it! I don’t know who you are, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to him, Dick,” said Frank, stepping up.
“He is nobody but a common rascal who tried to sell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the game to this other man yesterday. He was umpiring,
and his dirty work made the crowd so angry
that it came near mobbing him.”</p>

<p>“It was your dirty kicking that gave the crowd
the impression that I was roasting,” snarled Derring.
“The Stars will bury you to-morrow. You’ll not get
a score.”</p>

<p>“Not a score,” growled Hazen.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a thousand dollars we beat the Stars!”
cried Dick, boylike.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the bet!” came from Hazen. “Put up
your money.”</p>

<p>“If I had it, I’d put it up. Frank, let me have the
money&mdash;do! You may take it out of my share if I
lose. But I can’t lose! Won’t you let me have the
money?”</p>

<p>Merry shook his head.</p>

<p>“I do not believe in betting, Dick,” he said. “It is
gambling, and gambling has ruined many good men.”</p>

<p>Hazen and Derring laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“You’re a squealer, Merriwell!” declared the stout
sporting man. “That’s what’s the matter with you!
You lack nerve!”</p>

<p>“That’s not true!” flung back Dick. “Anybody
knows better than that!”</p>

<p>“It is true. If he had the least nerve, he would
back you up. I took your bet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“Knowing you were talking to a mere boy who
had no right to make such a bet. It is like you.
Anybody else would not have taken him in earnest.”</p>

<p>“Squealer!” sneered Derring.</p>

<p>“Let me have the money, Frank&mdash;please!” entreated
Dick.</p>

<p>A sudden resolve seized on Merry.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you have it on one condition,” he said.</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“You are not to take the winning yourself, but are
to donate it to some charitable institution in this city.”</p>

<p>To this Dick immediately agreed, and then Frank
said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hazen, my brother will meet you an hour
from now in the office of the hotel where we are stopping,
and we’ll place the money in the hands of the
proprietor.”</p>

<p>“If you fail to show up,” said Hazen, “I’ll get up
on the bleachers to-morrow and tell everybody how
you squealed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry; we’ll not fail to show up.”</p>

<p>Then Merry led the way to the place where a cab
was waiting. The ex-Yale man, the boy, and the old
Indian entered the cab and were driven away.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">READY TO PLAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Frank’s challenge and the acceptance of Manager
Wilson had appeared in the Omaha papers, and the
result was that a great crowd gathered at the baseball-grounds
the afternoon of the day on which the
Merries were again to meet the home team.</p>

<p>The Stars were first on the field, and they were
given a round of applause. Their practise-work was
snappy and aroused no small amount of enthusiasm.
Then came Merriwell’s team, trotting out onto the field
as the Stars came in.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted a man. “There they are!
They’re the boys who play clean baseball!”</p>

<p>The applause received by Frank and his men plainly
showed they were favorites.</p>

<p>“Look at the kid!” cried somebody. “Why, are
they going to use that boy?”</p>

<p>“They must be crazy!”</p>

<p>“He can’t play ball in this company.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t over fourteen.”</p>

<p>“He’s going in short.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the short-stop they had yesterday?”</p>

<p>“There he goes into right field. The right-fielder
is on the bench, I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid this game won’t be much like the game
yesterday. Our boys will have a snap.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the fear of most of the spectators,
and yet Merriwell’s team received applause for
its sharp practise-work.</p>

<p>Carker was batting to the infield, while one of the
Stars batted to the outfield. Greg put the first ball
down to Dick. It was a slow one, and the boy
handled it successfully, throwing over to first on a
line.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good,” said a man.</p>

<p>“But it was easy,” asserted another. “Wait till a
hot one comes down.”</p>

<p>A hot one did come down when Greg again batted
to Dick, and the boy jumped in front of it, stopped it
handsomely, handled it, whistled it across, and won
a generous hand from the witnesses.</p>

<p>“I believe the kid can play!” cried a man.</p>

<p>“But he’ll never be able to hit Batch,” asserted another.</p>

<p>The time for the game to be called approached,
and now the umpire appeared. Frank called his men
in, and Dorrity courteously gave him the choice of
innings.</p>

<p>“We’ll start with our outs,” said Merry, and they
again entered the field.</p>

<p>“Play ball!”</p>

<p>The voice of the umpire rang out. The batter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
stepped up to the plate. The crowd settled down to
watch the fun.</p>

<p>The batting-orders of the teams were as follows:</p>

<p>“Remember what we did to him last time, Bill, old
boy,” cried Dorrity, as Teller stepped up to the plate.
“Get against the first one he puts over.”</p>

<p>Teller grinned.</p>

<p>It was Frank’s practise to put the first ball over,
and he did so. Teller did not wait. He cracked
the ball hard, and drove it like a bullet straight at
Dick Merriwell. It seemed too hot for the boy to
handle, and many expected to see Dick try to dodge
it. Instead of dodging, however, the lad took the
ball, though it made him stagger, and held it.</p>

<p>“Batter out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>“Well! well! well!” roared that familiar hoarse
voice. “Did you see that? How did he do it?”</p>

<p>“Simplest thing in the world, my good people,” said
Jack Ready. “Wait till you see him eat grounders.”</p>

<p>“Pretty, Dick&mdash;pretty,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>Dick laughed.</p>

<p>“It burned my hands,” he admitted; “but it felt
good.”</p>

<p>From the moment Frank heard Dick say that that
hot ball burned his hands and yet felt good, he never
had a doubt concerning the ability of the lad to
make a ball-player. The ball-player who is valuable
likes the feeling of a ball that comes hot into his
clutch, and he is not afraid of being hurt. The moment
a man becomes afraid of being hurt he begins
to go down-hill as a player, and he is liable to become
utterly useless.</p>

<p>Skew was confident when he came up to the plate.</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” he said. “Everybody can hit
Merriwell. I’ll get a hit.”</p>

<p>Frank tried to work him, but Skew had a good eye
for the ball, and Merry was forced to put it over.
Then the batter hit the sphere hard, and it went
spinning along the ground just inside the third-base
line.</p>

<p>Ready jumped, flung himself forward, thrust down
his right hand, and got the ball. It was a marvelous
stop, but Jack dropped on one knee in his effort, and
Skew was running like the wind to first.</p>

<p>Up sprang Ready, and he whistled the ball across
the diamond with the speed of a bullet. Browning
smothered it, though forced to stretch at full length
on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“Out at first!” declared Morrisy.</p>

<p>Skew started to raise a kick, but the crowd howled
at him, and he closed up.</p>

<p>“Talk about luck!” said O’Grady, as he marched
up to the plate. “They can’t keep it up.”</p>

<p>“Put them right over, Merriwell,” cried Rattleton.
“You have eight men playing with you.”</p>

<p>“Put one over&mdash;put it over!” nodded O’Grady. “I’ll
drive it out of the lot.”</p>

<p>Frank accepted the invitation. O’Grady hit it fair,
and it went bounding along the ground in a nasty
manner between Ready and Dick.</p>

<p>Jack jumped for it, but could not get his hand on
the ball. He thought it had gone past for a hit when
he turned and saw Dick straightening up with the
ball in his hand.</p>

<p>The boy had made another marvelous stop, and he
sent the sphere across the diamond to first in time to
get the runner.</p>

<p>Three men were out, and the Merries came trotting
in from the field.</p>

<p>“Great support, fellows!” said Frank. “That’s
what I want to-day. I don’t believe I can throw
much of anything in the way of curves. If you continue
to back me up like that, the game is ours.”</p>

<p>Ready had his arm over Dick Merriwell’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“He is the baseball wonder of the age!” Jack as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>serted,
in his laughing way. “Up to date, I have
regarded myself as it, but the laurels have been torn
from my fair brow by a boy. I am green with jealousy.”</p>

<p>“You’re green, anyhow,” said Browning.</p>

<p>“There’s the man I bet with!” exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>Hazen and Derring were sitting on the bleachers
directly behind the visiting players’ bench.</p>

<p>“I hear he put up a large wad on the game,” said
Jack. “I think he will lose his little roll to-day, all
right, all right.”</p>

<p>As they approached the bench a singular figure
rose from somewhere. It was Old Joe Crowfoot,
wrapped in his dirty red blanket and smoking his
black pipe.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he exclaimed, his eyes fastened on Dick.
“Injun Heart him catch bullet next! Heap good
playing!”</p>

<p>Then he sat on the bench beside Dick, of whom
he was very proud, though he concealed his pride
pretty well.</p>

<p>Ready selected a bat and advanced to the plate.</p>

<p>“Kindly accommodate me by giving me a straight
one, Mr. Batch,” he urged. “You know I like you,
and I won’t do a thing to you&mdash;if I get a chance.”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said Batch.</p>

<p>But it was a rise, and Jack struck under it a foot.</p>

<p>“I think you are a prevaricator!” said the batter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
quickly. “I regret very much to apply such a title
to you, but it fits like your skin.”</p>

<p>“Well, try the next one,” said Batch.</p>

<p>Jack declined, however, for it was a wide out
curve, and a ball was called.</p>

<p>“That makes us even,” said Ready. “Now we’ll
begin over.”</p>

<p>The next one was too close, and Jack let it pass.</p>

<p>“Ball two!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” said Jack. “I’m getting a lead on you.”</p>

<p>Batch set his teeth and put in a drop. Jack struck
over it.</p>

<p>“The advantage is mine,” said the pitcher.</p>

<p>“See if you can keep it,” said Ready.</p>

<p>Then Batch tried a high one, and the third ball was
called.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” said Ready. “Things are coming my
way.”</p>

<p>Batch looked resolute, and his next one seemed
like a straight ball over the very heart of the plate.
Ready went after it, but it proved to be an elusive
drop, and was not touched.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Batch laughed at Ready, who retired in a very dejected
manner to the bench.</p>

<p>Carson came next, and he waited till Batch put
one over. Then Berlin hit the ball hard, but drove
it into the air, so that O’Grady easily captured it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>Two men were out, and the crowd began to realize
that the game was rather swift.</p>

<p>Hodge looked grim and resolute as he advanced
to the plate. He had his favorite stick, and Gamp
called:</p>

<p>“Cuc-cuc-cuc-come, now, Hodge, pup-pup-pup-put
us into the gug-gug-gug-game! Give us a regular
Texas Leaguer!”</p>

<p>Bart was a splendid hitter when in good form, and
the outfielders moved back a little, while the infield
played deep. Noticing this, Bart suddenly sprang a
surprise by bunting the first ball pitched.</p>

<p>The ball rolled down toward third, and Bart was
off like a dart for first. The third-baseman was too
far away to get it, and the pitcher was too astonished.
By the time the catcher got the ball Bart was too near
first for a throw to do any good.</p>

<p>“Well! well! well!” cried Ready, as he trotted down
to coach. “Why didn’t I think of that? It’s just as
easy!”</p>

<p>Batch growled like a dog with a sore ear.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t get a hit any other way,” he said.</p>

<p>Now, Gamp was another heavy hitter, and surely
there was no danger that he would bunt. At least,
everybody thought so.</p>

<p>Joe, however, was up to snuff, and he saw the
Stars were expecting him to swing hard. Thus it happened
that, as the ball was pitched, Gamp suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
shortened his hold on the bat, bunted handsomely, and
went prancing down to first, while Hodge raced to
second.</p>

<p>Hanson was swearing as he dove after the ball.
This time Batch went for it, too, and they collided,
the ball rolling off to one side as one of them kicked
it.</p>

<p>Bart fancied he saw his opportunity, and he sped
for third. Hanson recovered, made a froglike leap
for the ball, got it, and threw to third.</p>

<p>Hodge slid, but he was not near enough to reach
the bag, and Corrigan tagged him out.</p>

<p>Three men were retired, and neither side had scored
in the first inning.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">ONE TO NOTHING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“But we gave ’em an awful fright,” laughed Ready,
his apple cheeks glowing.</p>

<p>“I was a fool to try to make third on that!” growled
Hodge. “Somebody ought to shoot me!”</p>

<p>“It is taking chances that win games,” said Merry.
“If you had reached that bag, we’d all have thought
it clever work.”</p>

<p>Frank went into the box again. His arm was feeling
bad, but he wished to pitch as much of the game
as possible, and he had no thought of giving up for
some time.</p>

<p>“Everybody hit him before,” said Dorrity. “Let’s
make ’em good this time.”</p>

<p>Hanson was the first man up, and he was breathing
heavily. Frank gave him no time to rest, but sent
one straight over. Hanson hit it and sent it sailing
out for a short hit over the infield. Every one
thought it was a hit.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell raced back after the ball, looking
over his shoulder to see it coming down. As it
dropped, he jumped forward, caught it with his right
hand, dropped it, but caught it with his left before it
could fall to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>As the boy turned, with the ball in his hands, the
crowd rose up and gave him a cheer.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything like that?” roared the
man with the hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“Never in my life!” shrieked one with a shrill
voice.</p>

<p>“Kid, you’re all right!” came from various quarters.</p>

<p>“Who is that boy?” was the question that passed
from lip to lip.</p>

<p>At length somebody found out the truth, and then
men and women were saying:</p>

<p>“Why, he’s Frank Merriwell’s brother! No wonder
he can play ball!”</p>

<p>But Dick paid no attention to the crowd. His mind
was on the game and nothing else.</p>

<p>“A base-hit spoiled!” muttered Hanson, as he came
in to the bench. “He tumbled into that! Couldn’t
do it again in a thousand years!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” agreed Dorrity.</p>

<p>Jack was the next man to step up to the plate.
By a strange chance, he hit a ball that was almost the
exact duplicate of the one batted by Hanson.</p>

<p>“He won’t get that!”</p>

<p>But Dick raced for the ball as fast as he could, and
when it came down he clutched it and held on, though
he struck his toe against something and fell headlong.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
The boy dropped on his stomach, holding the ball clear
of the ground with both hands.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>The grand stand and bleachers rose up and roared
and roared. Never before on those grounds had two
such sensational catches been made in succession.</p>

<p>It was some time before the admiring crowd grew
quiet, and then Jack Ready was heard saying:</p>

<p>“It was nothing but an accident, my good people;
but he has a way of making those accidents just as
regularly as he eats his meals.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s a corker!” howled the man with the
hoarse voice. “He’s the best short-stop I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, silver-throated sir,” said Ready, doffing
his cap. “He is too modest to speak for himself.
I am a trifle shy, but not quite as shy as he is.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” growled Hazen, his
red face redder than usual.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it happened,” said Derring.</p>

<p>Wescott joined them and he said:</p>

<p>“The boy is a wonder! There is no doubt about
it. If he keeps on he’ll be playing in one of the
big leagues before he is out of his teens.”</p>

<p>“But, of course, he can’t hit any,” said Derring.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether he can or not. We’ll wait
and see.”</p>

<p>Maloney was the next man, and Frank smilingly
gave him one over the heart of the plate. Maloney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
cracked it straight out to Gamp, who gathered it in,
and the Merries came trotting in to the bench.</p>

<p>“Talk about support!” laughed Merry. “Why,
you’re all marvels to-day!”</p>

<p>“The tender youth killed two hits in that inning,”
said Ready.</p>

<p>Old Joe simply grunted at Dick, saying:</p>

<p>“Much good! Do him some more.”</p>

<p>Frank came to bat first, and Batch resolved to
strike Merry out. This, however, was not an easy
thing to do, and Frank found the ball for a safe
single past second.</p>

<p>“Now, we’re off!” cried Carson. “We have
started the ball. We’ll keep it up.”</p>

<p>Browning came up to strike. As he did so, Frank
touched his cap twice. Bruce opened and closed his
fingers on the bat-handle twice, and thus a signal
passed between them, which meant that Merry would
try to steal second on the second ball pitched.</p>

<p>The first one was wide, and the umpire called it a
ball. The next was fairly over, but Bruce swung
with the deliberate intention of missing it and bewildering
the catcher. He swung hard and reeled
back a little, dropping his bat.</p>

<p>Merry was streaking it to second, and the catcher
was baffled so that he could not get the throw away
in time to catch him. This was team-work, and
it counted in giving Merry second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Now Browning was ready to nail the ball, and he
hit the very next one pitched. The ball went past
Batch like a streak and out over second. Frank
dusted to third and Ready sent him home.</p>

<p>The center-fielder had stopped the ball and thrown
to second. The baseman there whirled and drove the
ball to the plate, but he was a moment too late, and
Frank had scored.</p>

<p>Browning took second on the throw to the plate.</p>

<p>“Now, we’re in the game!” cried Ready. “That’s
the kind of work! Keep it up!”</p>

<p>The crowd cheered and cheered.</p>

<p>Swiftwing was the next batter, and he drove the
ball hard. It looked like a hit, and Browning went
for third. When it was too late, Ready saw the ball
would be caught. He tried to turn Bruce back, but
O’Grady got the ball and threw it to second, thus
making a double play.</p>

<p>Batch had a return of confidence when he saw Rattleton
face him, and he proceeded to strike Harry out
in short order. But the Merries had the lead.</p>

<p>Could they hold it?</p>

<p>Again Frank went into the box, and again his support
was of the finest order. He did not strike out
a man, but the first three men up went out in order,
two flying to the outfield and one being thrown out
at first by Dick.</p>

<p>Dick was the first one to come to bat in the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of the third. Batch thought the boy must be easy,
and he put a swift one right over.</p>

<p>Dick met it, and the ball went out for a pretty
single. On first, Dick touched his cap once as Ready
stood up to the plate. In return, Ready opened and
closed his hands once on the handle of the bat.</p>

<p>Then, when the first ball was pitched, Dick went
down to second with such speed that the spectators
gasped. Hanson threw to stop the boy, but Dick was
there a long time in advance of the ball.</p>

<p>“Pretty stealing!” cried Ready.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Old Joe. “When Injun him steal,
white man say bad stealing. Heap different in baseball.”</p>

<p>Ready did his best to get a hit, but Batch struck
him out.</p>

<p>Carson was anxious for a hit. In fact, he was too
anxious. He swung at two that would have been
balls, and two strikes were called.</p>

<p>Getting a good lead, Dick stole third on the next
pitched ball, while Carson struck out.</p>

<p>Hodge was determined to bring the boy home.
He picked out a pretty one and hit it hard. The ball
went on a line into the hands of Dorrity, and Dick
was left on third.</p>

<p>The spectators realized by this time that they were
seeing a game of baseball that was the genuine thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>For the fourth time, Frank went into the box.
He tried a drop to start with, and Teller led off with
a hit. That drop hurt Frank’s wrist, and he decided
that he could not use it any more.</p>

<p>Skew got a good one and dropped out a scratch
hit that advanced Teller to second. Then O’Grady
came up and smashed a hot one at Dick. The boy
managed to handle it, but saw he could not get either
Teller or Skew, which led him to throw to first.
O’Grady was out, but the Stars had a man on second
and third.</p>

<p>Hanson had fire in his eye when he came to the
plate. He got a good one and sent a long fly into
right field. Teller held third till the fly was caught.
The instant it dropped into the hands of Carson he
scooted for home.</p>

<p>Carson threw to second, but Rattleton found it
useless to throw home, and Skew was too near third.
The Stars had tied the score.</p>

<p>Two men were out, and Skew was on third. With
Jack up, it seemed possible that another run would
come in, which would put the Stars in the lead.</p>

<p>Had Frank been able to throw the double-shoot
the scoring would have stopped beyond a doubt;
but his wrist was so bad that he could not get the
full effect of ordinary curves.</p>

<p>Merry was cautious, and Jack waited till three balls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
were called. Then Frank put one right over, and
the batter lifted it.</p>

<p>Swiftwing had a long run for the ball, but he made
his legs fly, and he took it as it came down. The
inning was over, but the score was tied&mdash;one to one.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">THE WINNING RUN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In vain the Merries tried to send a man round the
bags in the last of the fourth. The Stars played fast
ball, and nobody got past second base.</p>

<p>Then came a surprise, for Frank Merriwell retired
to short and his brother took his place to pitch. Frank
had set Dick to warming up as soon as they came
in to the bench, and the boy was ready.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a picnic!” cried Maloney, as he came
up to the bat. “It’s all over now!”</p>

<p>Dick closed his lips firmly, took Bart’s signal,
nodded, and prepared to deliver the ball.</p>

<p>Maloney slashed at the very first one, which came
sailing up to the plate in a dead manner, and the bat
did not come within a foot of the ball.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at his speed!” cried some of the spectators,
in derision.</p>

<p>“Put ’em over! put ’em over!” snarled Maloney.
“This is no monkey show!”</p>

<p>“Take the gentleman at bat off the grounds,”
cried Ready. “He’ll think differently after he gets
through hitting this time.”</p>

<p>Dick had nerve, for he pitched the next ball in ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>actly
the same manner, and again Maloney failed to
touch it.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>Then something happened. The next ball came in
with the speed of the wind. Maloney thought it
was a straight one, and he struck hard at it. Just
as the batter swung it seemed that the ball took a
strange upward jump in the air, and the third strike
had been made.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” said the umpire, as the ball plunked
into the mitt of Bart Hodge and remained there.</p>

<p>“Hooraw!” bellowed the man with the hoarse
voice. “Why, the little divvil can pitch, just as well as
he can do anything else! Did you ever seen his match?”</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” growled Hazen;
“He has some speed.”</p>

<p>“And a mighty queer rise ball,” nodded Wescott.</p>

<p>“They’ll get on to him, don’t worry,” said Derring.
“He is too young to pitch in this class. We
are sure of winning, so your money is safe, Hazen.”</p>

<p>But Hazen was not perfectly easy.</p>

<p>Corrigan followed Maloney, and Dick started with
the jump ball, at which the batter slashed hard.</p>

<p>“Throw that again,” invited Corrigan.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said the boy, and, true to his word,
he put it over.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!” cried the umpire, as Corrigan failed
to connect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“You little imp!” exclaimed the batter, his face
very red. “Give me one more!”</p>

<p>But Dick threw a drop for the third one, and Corrigan
struck over it a foot.</p>

<p>Two batters were out.</p>

<p>“Here! here!” cried Ready to Dick. “Stop that,
will you? You’re not giving us a chance. I’m getting
tired doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“Let the poor fellows hit one once in a while,”
urged Rattleton.</p>

<p>But Dick did not seem inclined to obey, for he
made the same kind of a mark of Dorrity, striking
three men out in the first inning he pitched.</p>

<p>In their half of the fifth the Merries could not
score, and the tally remained tied.</p>

<p>The pitching of Dick Merriwell during the rest of
the game was the wonder of all who witnessed it.
The boy had all kinds of speed, perfect control, and
a cool head. His manner of mixing fast and slow
balls bothered the batters, while not one of them could
touch his jump ball.</p>

<p>Inning after inning passed, and still neither side
made a run.</p>

<p>Hazen was anxious, and, at last, he became desperate.</p>

<p>“Confound that boy!” he snarled. “Is he going
to be the cause of my losing a pot of money?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” confessed Wescott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“Hold on,” urged Derring. “He can’t keep it up.
Something will happen.”</p>

<p>And so the desperate gambler made no move,
hoping all the time that something would happen.</p>

<p>Straight through to the ninth Dick pitched without
permitting the home team to get another run.
In the ninth he used the jump ball and the drop, and
not a man fouled the ball, much less hit it out.</p>

<p>Rattleton was the first hitter for the Merries in
the ninth. Batch had Harry’s weak spot, and he
fanned him.</p>

<p>Then came Dick. Now, Batch had not fanned the
boy during the game, and he was determined to do
so this time. His determination led him to give the
lad his first on balls, Dick waiting prettily.</p>

<p>Again a signal passed between Dick and Ready,
and the boy stole second on the second ball pitched.</p>

<p>Ready hit the next ball pitched. It was a fly to
right field, and Maloney got it. But Dick held second
on the fly, running after it was caught, and got third.</p>

<p>Two men were out, but a hit meant the winning
run. Bart drove into the first ball pitched, sending
it on the ground past second, and Dick came racing
home, while the crowd rose up and roared its applause.</p>

<p>Hazen had lost his bets.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="fs70">A DESPERATE SITUATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Merry and his team had reached Minneapolis, and,
having no game on hand, decided to witness the contest
between the home team and St. Paul. The game
proved an exciting one.</p>

<p>The visitors had a big crowd of fans with them,
and they put up a great fight for the game. Foley,
the pitcher for St. Paul, had been much harder hit
than Webber, of the home team, but his support, up
to the sixth inning, had been masterly, and Minneapolis
had been unable to squeeze in more than one run.
St. Paul had not scored.</p>

<p>In the first half of the sixth, with two men out
and no one on the bases, Foley went to the bat and hit
the ball hard to short. The short-stop fumbled and
then made a swift throw to first, but Foley was a
good runner and he made a mad try for the bag.</p>

<p>Had Foley been an “old stager” he would not have
tried the trick he did; but he was a new man from
some Eastern college. He flung himself headlong at
the bag.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was great excitement in the
grand stand and on the bleachers, and loud cries were
heard of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“Foley is hurt!”</p>

<p>“Give him a runner!”</p>

<p>“Prince spiked him!”</p>

<p>“Shame! Shame!”</p>

<p>“That’s dirty ball-playing!”</p>

<p>Foley reached first safely, having his hand upon
it when the baseman caught the ball.</p>

<p>“Safe!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>Then the angry baseman quickly spiked Foley’s
hand. It was, in truth, dirty ball-playing, and the
visiting spectators had good cause to become incensed.</p>

<p>Foley’s right hand was the one injured, and the
injury was bad enough to put him out of the game.
Several players ran down to first from the St. Paul
bench.</p>

<p>“Lynch Prince!” yelled the spectators.</p>

<p>“Mob him!”</p>

<p>“Kick him!”</p>

<p>“Kill him!”</p>

<p>It seemed that the spectators would pour onto the
diamond, but several officers appeared and did their
best to hold the crowd back.</p>

<p>Trueman, the captain of the visiting team, had
reached the side of the injured player.</p>

<p>“How bad has he hurt you, old man?” he anxiously
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>For answer Foley held up his bleeding hand, which
Trueman examined.</p>

<p>“The cur!” grated Trueman, giving Prince a black
look. “He ought to be shot!”</p>

<p>“Ah! ’twas an accident!” snapped Prince. “W’at’s
ther matter wid yer?”</p>

<p>One of the St. Paul players made a lunge at Prince
to strike him, but two others grabbed him and held
him back.</p>

<p>“Give this man a runner, Stebson,” said Trueman
to the captain of the home team.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Stebson, and he picked out a man,
while Foley walked back to the bench, accompanied
by his friends.</p>

<p>The spectators continued to howl, but the game
went on. A doctor was handy, and he examined
Foley’s injury.</p>

<p>“He’ll not pitch again for two weeks,” said the
doctor.</p>

<p>“That knocks us out!” groaned Trueman bitterly.
“Every other pitcher we have is used up, and those
fellows knew it. What a dastardly mean way to win
a game!”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked another player.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to put in anybody we can and let
those duffers hit it out, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The next batter lifted an infield fly to third and
was out. The time had come for the visiting team to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
take the field. Trueman asked the umpire to call time
until he could decide who should go in to pitch.</p>

<p>Two pitchers were on the bench, but one of them
was sick and the other had an arm that would not
enable him to throw the ball up to the plate. It did
seem that it was “all off.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that jay who threw some for the batters
to hit before the game?” asked somebody. “You
might try him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’d be a mark in a game!” declared a player.
“He’s the greenest thing that ever happened.”</p>

<p>“But he did have speed.”</p>

<p>“And some curves.”</p>

<p>“You must have somebody, Trueman.”</p>

<p>The captain of the visiting team looked round in
despair. The first person he saw, sitting not far
away on the bleachers, was a raw-looking countryman
in a suit of clothes that were about twenty years
out of date. The countryman wore a narrow-brimmed,
low-crowned, rusty derby hat, a spike-tailed
coat of grandfather’s days, high-water trousers,
which bagged at the knees and were a mile too
loose, a pair of long-legged boots with dried mud on
them, and a standing collar that was not much more
than half an inch high. His bright red necktie was
tied in a huge bow, and his white shirt was rather
soiled. From beneath the derby hat flowed a mass
of carroty hair that was straight and coarse. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
face did not look very clean, and he wore a grin that
was almost idiotic.</p>

<p>When Trueman’s eyes rested on this person the
latter nodded and winked, then rose, sprang over the
rail, and slouched awkwardly toward the bench of the
visiting players.</p>

<p>“Gol-darn hard luck!” he said. “Can’t that feller
pitch enny more?”</p>

<p>“Not this game.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! He’s a purty good man, cap’n. Who
be you goin’ to put in his place?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t a pitcher left.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Why, ding it! this is my chance!
I’ll go in fer ye.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Jest you give me a try. I’ve bin wantin’
to pitch in fast comp’ny fer a long time. I’ll jest
nacherly s’prise them other chaps.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever pitch anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Did I? Cap’n, I pitched on the Mud Creek team
a hull season an’ never lost a game.”</p>

<p>“Mud Creek! Well, this is somewhat different.
I don’t believe I have any use for you.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, cap’n, don’t be foolish! You say
you hain’t got nary other pitcher?”</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got ter put in somebody.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“If you put in a man that ain’t a pitcher you’re
bound to lose the game.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m a pitcher. Even if I lose the game for ye,
you won’t be no wuss off.”</p>

<p>Trueman said nothing.</p>

<p>“But I hain’t goin’ to do it,” persisted the jay.
“If your fellers will s’port me the way they have
your other pitcher, I won’t let them other chaps git
a darn run!”</p>

<p>Trueman shook his head.</p>

<p>“The crowd would guy us,” he said.</p>

<p>“Let ’em guy an’ be hanged to ’em!” exclaimed
the countryman. “Mebbe we’ll be able to take some
of the guyin’ aout of ’em before we’re done. Look
here, some of your fellers batted when I was tossin’
em’ up before the game. Ask them if I ain’t got some
curves?”</p>

<p>“Curves don’t cut much ice if a man hasn’t a head
and experience.”</p>

<p>“I’ll jest bet you a chaw of terbacker that you’ll
say my head’s all right before I’ve pitched long. You
don’t want to use up any of your other men pitchin’,
so let me see what I can do. Come on, boss; you
won’t be sorry.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Trueman suddenly; “I’ll do it.”</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">THE JAY PITCHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“You won’t never regret it!” chuckled the jay in
deep satisfaction. “I’m goin’ to make them fellers
look like twenty-nine cents.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to get into a suit?”</p>

<p>“Not this innin’. I’ll jest peel off my co’t an’ go
out jest as I be.”</p>

<p>He had his coat off in a minute, and then he flung
aside his vest. The grin on his face was one of
great satisfaction, and he presented a comical aspect.</p>

<p>Keen, the catcher, ran up and grasped Trueman’s
arm.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” he asked. “Are
you going to put that man in?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then the game will be a farce! We had better
stop at once than to make an exhibition of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“We’ll play it out,” said Trueman grimly.</p>

<p>Then he called the captain of the other team and
told him what he intended doing. Stebson laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you, Trueman,” he said; “but we’ll
pound that jay all over the field.”</p>

<p>“I expect you will,” nodded Trueman gloomily;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
“but I can’t help it. You do not object to him, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Then he goes in.”</p>

<p>The excited crowd had been wondering what was
going to happen, and few of the spectators understood
when they saw the countryman fling off his
coat and vest.</p>

<p>However, when the farmerish youth walked out
to the pitcher’s box a great shout of derision went
up.</p>

<p>“Look at that!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Where did it come from?”</p>

<p>“Rube! Rube!”</p>

<p>“He’s going to pitch!”</p>

<p>There were shouts of laughter, and everybody felt
that a good game had suddenly degenerated into a
ridiculous exhibition.</p>

<p>The stranger ambled along awkwardly as he
walked onto the diamond, his shoulders pitched forward,
and his arms swinging in a queer way. That
half-foolish grin remained on his face, but he did not
seem at all disturbed by the shouts and laughter of
the crowd.</p>

<p>“Jest give me a few seconds to limber my arm,
Mr. Empire?” he asked.</p>

<p>The umpire nodded, and the stranger faced first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
base. He threw awkwardly, and did not seem to put
much force into the throw.</p>

<p>“He’ll be pudding for our batters,” said a Minneapolis
man. “Come, let’s get out.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said a dark-faced man at his side. “I
have money bet on this game, and I want to make
sure I’ll win.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure enough now,” said the other, who
had a thin, pale face and a listless manner.</p>

<p>“I want to see him pitch a few.”</p>

<p>“Bet the first man gets a hit.”</p>

<p>“I expect he will.”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The batter stepped up to the plate, and then the
new pitcher motioned for the catcher to meet him,
in order to get the signals.</p>

<p>Keen sullenly came down and told the countryman
what the signals were.</p>

<p>“Do you think you kin hold me?” asked the jay.</p>

<p>“Hold you?” exclaimed Keen. “Well, if I can’t
I’ll give up trying to catch!”</p>

<p>“All right,” grinned the new pitcher. “We’ll see
what we kin do.”</p>

<p>Keen returned to his position and adjusted his
mask. Then he gave a sign, and the jay prepared to
deliver the ball. The movements of the countryman
in his delivery were very queer, and the crowd shouted
with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Get onto his delivery!” cried many.</p>

<p>The first ball came sailing up to the batter “as
large as a barn,” and the man tried to hit it, but
struck too soon.</p>

<p>“There’s speed for you!” laughed Stebson.</p>

<p>“Oh, brace up!” cried the batter. “What do you
think this is, anyhow?”</p>

<p>The jay grinned.</p>

<p>“Didn’t hit it, did ye?” he said.</p>

<p>Keen sent the ball back hotly with a snap throw,
but the pitcher caught it with one hand, not seeming
to mind it at all.</p>

<p>Then he went through more erratic movements,
swung his right arm, thrust out his left, and jerked
the ball through under his left arm, sending it over
the plate.</p>

<p>The movement was so surprising that the batter
failed to strike at all.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be kicked!” gasped the batter.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” laughed the jay. “That’s
one on you, by gorry! Didn’t know I had that up
my sleeve, did ye? It’s one I learnt off a feller by
the name of Wiley, an’ he’s purty good when he has
a mind to be. I’ll show ye lots of queer quirks before
I’m done with ye.”</p>

<p>Following this he cut several peculiar geometrical
figures in the air with the ball, laid it exactly on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
back of his neck, looked hard at the batter, and sent
in one that had the speed of a darting swallow.</p>

<p>The batter struck too slowly, and the ball went
straight through the hands of the catcher, striking
against his body-protector, then falling to the ground.</p>

<p>“Did you see that?” cried twenty persons.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” roared the jay, as the
umpire declared the batter out, the catcher having
caught up the ball and tagged the surprised man.
“Why, I didn’t s’pose you was so easy! Stand up
yer next victim.”</p>

<p>The witnesses were quite as surprised as the batter
had been.</p>

<p>“He struck him out!”</p>

<p>“How did he do it?”</p>

<p>“It was an accident!”</p>

<p>“Robinson will hit him.”</p>

<p>Robinson was the following batter. He laughed
at the one who had struck out, saying:</p>

<p>“Well, you must feel foolish! Before I’d let that
object do such a thing to me!”</p>

<p>Then he stepped quickly up to the plate. He was
a great hitter, having connected with the ball every
time up during the game thus far.</p>

<p>The jay took the sphere in his hand, glared at
Robinson, then made a swing, and sent in one of his
speedy ones. The moment the ball left his hand the
queer pitcher yelled:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Look aout!”</p>

<p>Robinson dropped just in time to avoid being hit
by the ball, which fairly whizzed as it passed his
head. The catcher was not quick enough to stop the
ball at all.</p>

<p>Up on the bleachers rose another farmerish-looking
fellow, who, however, was dressed in good taste,
and who shouted:</p>

<p>“Look out there, Bub-Bub-Bub-Bill! You gol-dud-dud-dud-darn
fool! Dud-dud-dud-do you want to
kuk-kuk-kuk-kill somebody?”</p>

<p>“Jest a mistake, Joe,” returned the pitcher, with
a grin. “The consarned ball slipped.”</p>

<p>“Well, dud-dud-dud-don’t do it ag’in, for the lul-lul-lul-love
of goodness!” returned the chap on the
bleachers. “You know ha-haow you lul-lul-lul-laid up
Zeb Nobbins fuf-for six months by hittin’ him that
way.”</p>

<p>Then the spectator sat down, looking rather anxious.
By this time all the spectators were getting
interested, while the players were beginning to mention
to one another that the jay had speed when he
chose to let it out.</p>

<p>The batter had been surprised and alarmed by the
swiftness of the ball, and he now said:</p>

<p>“Look here, you, don’t you hit me with that ball!
If you do, I’ll throw the bat at you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“If I do,” said the pitcher, “you won’t be in any
condition to throw the bat at ennybody, mister.”</p>

<p>Then he tied himself in a knot, as if intending to
use his highest speed, but sent in such a slow one that
Robinson swung too quick and was deceived. For the
third time the strange pitcher gave vent to that braying
laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, you chaps are the easiest fooled of anything
I ever struck!” he declared. “Why don’t ye
hit the ball, not dab at it that way? Git inter gear
an’ do somethin’.”</p>

<p>Trueman and the St. Paul players were looking
on in astonishment. This was something entirely unexpected,
and they were unable to make up their
minds in regard to its meaning.</p>

<p>The next ball delivered looked high, and the batter
did not swing at it; but it proved to be a drop,
and it went down across the batter’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Two strikes,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“What?” shouted Robinson.</p>

<p>“Don’t kick,” advised the jay. “You know you
was bad fooled. Hit the next one.”</p>

<p>Robinson was mad, and he slashed furiously at the
next ball pitched, which curved out and missed the
end of his bat by eight inches.</p>

<p>“Striker out!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>The jay had struck out the first two men, and now
the amazed spectators began to clap their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“Thankee,” said the queer fellow, touching the
brim of his rusty derby. “You’re jest beginnin’ to
’preciate me.”</p>

<p>The next hitter grasped a bat and sprang up to the
plate.</p>

<p>“Let’s see you strike me out!” he exclaimed. “I’ll
bet a dollar you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so wasteful of your money,” advised the
pitcher. “It may come in handy fer ye some time.”</p>

<p>The first ball was a high one, and it did not drop at
all. The batter chased after it.</p>

<p>“Yeou’re easier than t’other ones,” grinned the
Jay.</p>

<p>The batter set his teeth.</p>

<p>“Get ’em down!” cried several from the bench.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the pitcher, and he put the next
one right over, but with such speed that Keen
dropped it.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>The crowd roared.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw!” laughed the stranger. “I hain’t
hed so much fun sense I pitched agin’ the Sucker
Run fellers. They was purty easy, but you chaps are
easier than anything I ever seen.”</p>

<p>The next one looked good, but it was a trifle wide
and had a rise. However, the batter hit savagely
at it and was out.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried the stammering chap on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
bleachers, shooting up and waving his hat. “I
knowed you could dud-dud-dud-do it, Bill! They
can’t tut-tut-tut-touch ye!”</p>

<p>“Thankee, Joe,” said the jay. “They’re a dang
sight easier than I thought they wuz.”</p>

<p>Then he walked out of the box.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="fs70">GETTING OUT OF A TIGHT PLACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The astonished St. Paul men gathered round the
jay pitcher at the bench, Captain Trueman excitedly
asking:</p>

<p>“Good gracious, man; can you keep that up?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” was the answer. “Mebbe I can’t. Ye
see, I fooled ’em that time cause they thought I was
sech a darn easy mark.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that,” said Keen. “By Jove! you’ve
got the greatest speed of any man I ever saw when
you let it out! What in thunder have you in that
arm&mdash;a lot of springs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t begun to speed ’em,” declared the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Then, for the love of goodness, don’t! Those
hot ones burned right through the mitt.”</p>

<p>“My arm ain’t feelin’ jest right to-day,” said the
stranger. “It’s ruther stiff. Sometimes when it’s
all right I do have purty fair speed.”</p>

<p>“More than to-day?”</p>

<p>“Ruther more.”</p>

<p>“Well, can you find anybody to hold you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all in gittin’ used to a thing. When I’m all
right I ain’t very wild, an’ that makes it better for a
ketcher.”</p>

<p>The St. Paul men muttered among themselves, and
one of them told Trueman to sign the stranger if he
could keep that work up.</p>

<p>St. Paul again went out in order, and the new
pitcher once more ambled awkwardly out to his place.
This time, however, instead of being greeted with
howls of derision, he was given a round of applause,
in recognition of which he touched the brim of his
old hat, saying:</p>

<p>“That kinder makes me blush. I wisht they
wouldn’t pound their hands at me that way.”</p>

<p>The first Minneapolis batter to face the stranger
was anxious, but, after a ball was called, he succeeded
in hitting for a clean single. The crowd
shouted.</p>

<p>“It’s all over now,” said the man with the pale
face. “They will fall on that farmer like a load of
brick.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” nodded his dark companion. “His
queer movements bothered them at first, but they
won’t be troubled by them now.”</p>

<p>The pitcher seemed to get rattled, for he put a
beauty over the plate, and the next hitter drove one
to left field, though the ball fell so short that the
runner on first could not reach third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“Everybody hits him!” yelled the coachers. “Why,
we’ll make a hundred right here!”</p>

<p>Although the jay grinned, he was very wild, and
the next batter, being a good waiter, was given his
first on balls.</p>

<p>The bags were full.</p>

<p>Now the spectators broke out in derision of the
new pitcher, who grinned and waved his hand.</p>

<p>“I ain’t seen no runs comin’ in yit,” he said, apparently
not much disturbed.</p>

<p>“Take him out, Trueman,” advised the second-baseman.</p>

<p>But the captain shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nobody to put in,” he said.</p>

<p>The next hitter was caught by a sharp drop to
start with, and fanned once. Then came one that
looked fine, but it was a rise, and the batter struck
under it. That meant two strikes and no balls.</p>

<p>Immediately the pitcher began to try all kinds of
coaxers, but the batter declined to hit at any of
them. Three balls were called.</p>

<p>“Now he’s in a hole!” cried one of the coachers.
“He’s wild! He’ll never get it over!”</p>

<p>The batter appeared anxious to hit, but the jay
decided that the fellow was not nearly as anxious as
he looked. The queer fellow grinned at the batter,
took all the time permissible, then seemed to throw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the ball straight at him, uttering an exclamation as
it left his hand.</p>

<p>The batter sprang back. He was too late; he saw
the ball take a curve and pass over the plate.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The St. Paul players gasped. This was something
entirely unexpected.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” breathed the short-stop.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw!” laughed the jay. “That was
the time I fooled him fine! A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” came the echo from the
bleachers, and the stammerer was seen holding onto
his sides and roaring with laughter.</p>

<p>“How was that, Joe?” cried the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Sus-sus-sus-slick as goose-grease,” came back the
reply. “Dud-dud-do it ag’in!”</p>

<p>“Yes, do it again!” grated the next batter, as he
came up to the plate. “I’d like to see you!”</p>

<p>“Keep watch,” advised the pitcher. “You won’t
need eny spectacles. Here we go!”</p>

<p>He whistled over a high one, and the batter tried
for it, but missed cleanly.</p>

<p>Luckily, the ball did not get far away, though Keen
was unable to hold it. As the ball bounded from the
catcher’s hands the countryman came rushing up to
cover the home plate.</p>

<p>“Squeeze um,” he admonished.</p>

<p>The catcher called for a drop, and it came, causing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the batter to swipe for it with a swinging movement.
He touched it and a second strike was called.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re very hard,” grinned the
pitcher. “Try this one.”</p>

<p>But the batter would not be pulled, and a ball was
called.</p>

<p>“Purty good one, Mr. Empire,” said the jay. “It
cut a corner.”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll cut the darned old rubber in halves!”</p>

<p>He did so, and the batter struck out. Two men
had gone.</p>

<p>When the next hitter came up the man on third
proceeded to take long chances in hopes of scoring.
The first one was a ball, and the runner on third
went back quickly.</p>

<p>The jay faced the batter, rubbing his hands as if
to dry them, with the ball under his arm. He then
took the sphere and seemed about to start his swinging
movements for delivery.</p>

<p>The runner on third got off. Like a flash of light
the pitcher threw to third.</p>

<p>The baseman caught the ball and put it onto the
runner as the latter tried to get back.</p>

<p>“Out at third!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The home team had not scored after filling the bases.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” laughed the jay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” roared his stammering
friend on the bleachers.</p>

<p>The spectators were astonished by this sudden play,
and then the visiting crowd from over the river broke
into a wild shout of satisfaction and applause.</p>

<p>The jay ambled in toward the bench, his arms
swinging awkwardly, while his gait seemed to indicate
that he was used to walking over rough ground
behind a plow. He grinned in the same half-idiotic
manner, nodding to the shouting spectators.</p>

<p>Trueman rushed up and caught the fellow by the
hand, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“You got out of that hole splendidly! I thought
those men would get in one score, at least.”</p>

<p>“They never could have done northing of the kind
if the ketcher could hold me. I don’t dare to more’n
half let myself aout.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you have still greater speed?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I’ve gut a few things up my sleeve
that them other chaps never seen, b’gorry! I ain’t
tried to use my best curves at all. I don’t darst to
do it for fear of havin’ a parst ball.”</p>

<p>Trueman looked at the strange fellow, wondering
if he could be joking; but the jay seemed perfectly
serious, as if he actually meant every word he said.</p>

<p>“What kind of curves can you have that are so
wonderful?” exclaimed the captain of the St. Paul
team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“I gut a gol-ding funny ball,” was the answer. “It
curves both ways.”</p>

<p>“Curves both ways? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“In an’ aout.”</p>

<p>“An in and out? On one pitch?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Say!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do&mdash;string me?”</p>

<p>“Not a gol-darn bit,” answered the countryman,
as he took a seat on the players’ bench. “I kin do it.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the double-shoot!”</p>

<p>“That’s jest what it is.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one man in the country who can
throw it, and I have my doubts about his doing the
trick. That man is Frank Merriwell, and I’ve been
trying to get in communication with him for a week.
I’ll give him any kind of money to pitch for St. Paul
the rest of the season.”</p>

<p>“You say there ain’t but one man kin throw the
double-shoot?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“An’ he’s Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, by gum! I’ll make ye change your mind if
your ketcher kin hold me. The next feller I have
ter pitch to will get the double-shoot, an’ don’t you
fergit it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>Already the first batter was up to the plate, and
Webber was ready to deliver the ball. The visitors
were desperate.</p>

<p>Webber’s first one was an out drop, which the batter
caught and lifted over the infield for a clean
single. Then the coacher opened up by first, and the
excitement again grew feverish.</p>

<p>The rivalry between St. Paul and Minneapolis was
intense, and this kind of a game was nerve-straining
for the spectators.</p>

<p>Webber was angry because he had been hit by the
first man up, and he settled down to “burn ’em over.”</p>

<p>The next batter was eager to hit, and he fanned at
a high one. Webber fancied he had the fellow “going,”
and so he continued to work the high ball;
but the batter grew wise suddenly and refused to
bite. Three balls were called.</p>

<p>Webber had been holding the man on first close
to the bag, giving him no chance to steal. But now
the pitcher seemed to be in a bad hole. The coacher
was whooping things up in great shape.</p>

<p>“He’ll never put it over, Charley!” he cried. “Take
one! Take another!”</p>

<p>Webber must have become rattled, for he hit the
batter with the next ball pitched.</p>

<p>“Take your base,” directed the umpire.</p>

<p>In vain the Minneapolis men protested that the
batter had made no effort to dodge the ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Now the excitement was feverish. Two men were
on bases, and no one was out.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we win!” yelled the coacher, who
went prancing down to the line by third.</p>

<p>“Gol-ding if it don’t look that way!” grinned the
jay pitcher. “Who is the next batter?”</p>

<p>“Foley,” answered somebody. “You take his place.
It’s your turn.”</p>

<p>“Then you jest watch me put the wood to the ball
fer about two sacks,” laughed the odd fellow, as he
began pawing over the bats.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged Webber suddenly
whirled and threw to first. The runner had been
playing off, and he jumped to get back. The ball
struck him and bounded away.</p>

<p>Instantly the coachers sent both runners. The baseman
made a leap for the ball, got it, sent it to third.
The runner was out easily, being tagged when at least
four feet from the base.</p>

<p>Then the baseman threw to second. The runner
from first would have been safe had he not made a
slide that carried him past the bag, so that no part
of his person was touching the base when the ball was
put onto him.</p>

<p>“Out at third and second!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be dinged to goshfry!” gasped the jay,
in deep disgust. “They hed to do it jest when I was
going to ding the ball hard enough to knock the ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>celsior
out of the old thing! Ain’t that the dad-ding-dest
thing you ever seen!”</p>

<p>Webber laughed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It’s all over now!” cried the captain of the home
team. “Strike out the Rube, Phil.”</p>

<p>Up popped the jay’s stuttering friend on the
bleachers.</p>

<p>“I bub-bub-bub-bet any man tut-tut-tut-ten dollars
that pup-pup-pup-pitcher carn’t sus-sus-sus-strike him
out!” he yelled, wildly waving a roll of bills.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” cried twenty voices.</p>

<p>“I’ll sus-sus-sus-sit daown,” was the answer; “but
you cuc-cuc-cuc-carn’t back me daown.”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” brayed the jay at the plate.
“Ain’t no takers fer your money, Joe.”</p>

<p>Then Webber suddenly sent in a swift one, thinking
to take the batter unawares.</p>

<p>Crack! the bat met the ball.</p>

<p>It did not seem that the jay swung on the ball at
all. He simply gave a snap hit, but the ball went out
on a line. Later, when the ball got past a fielder and
went away down against center-field fence, from which
it glanced to one side, the spectators realized that it
had been hit “some.”</p>

<p>And the manner in which the strange pitcher
sprinted round the bases brought the St. Paul crowd
up yelling like madmen. Never before on that field
had they seen such a speedy runner on bases. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
seemed to pull his head down between his shoulders
and fairly fly, his legs twinkling like the spokes of
a swift-moving wheel. Over first and down to second
he went. By that time the ball had rebounded
from the fence, and the runner kept on to third.
Before third was reached the fielder had the ball and
was throwing it in to second.</p>

<p>“Whoa! whoa!” yelled the coacher at third, trying
to stop the flying runner.</p>

<p>But somehow the fellow had stretched up his head
and he turned his face for a look as he <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'went ove third'">went over
third</ins> without checking his speed.</p>

<p>The ball was in the air on the way to the second-baseman.</p>

<p>Then the witnesses saw a streak of boots and humanity
going in to the plate from third. It seemed
that all the condensed energy of the man was put
into the effort to reach the plate ahead of the ball.</p>

<p>“See him go!” yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>The pitcher’s stammering friend was standing on
the bleachers, waving his hat and howling like a
wild man. In fact, it had been a cry from him that
caused the runner to take such desperate chances
instead of obeying the coacher at third.</p>

<p>The crowd roared and gasped and grew silent.</p>

<p>The second-baseman took the ball, whirled like a
flash, and lined it to the plate. The catcher was there
to receive it and stop the run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>The throw was shoulder-high, and the runner suddenly
threw himself headlong for a slide. Never in
the history of the great national game had there been
such a beautiful slide on that ground. The fellow
seemed to scoot over the ground, and he was resting
with his hand on the plate when the catcher bored
the ball between his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Safe!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>What a roar went up! The strange pitcher had
stretched an ordinary three-bagger into a home run.</p>

<p>And tied the score!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE JAY SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A wild scene followed. The St. Paul players
rushed forward, lifted the jay, placed him on their
shoulders, and bore him aloft.</p>

<p>“Oh, say!” he cried, “don’t make such a dinged
fuss over a little thing like that! It makes me feel
’shamed! Put me down, for goshfrymighty sakes!”</p>

<p>But his words were drowned by the howling of the
spectators and the cheering of the happy players.</p>

<p>But what was the more surprising to the crowd
quickly followed. A boy ran out toward the players
who were holding the jay aloft, and he was followed
by the most remarkable figure ever seen on those
grounds.</p>

<p>The spectators saw an old weather-beaten and
wrinkled redskin, wrapped in a dirty red blanket.
This old fellow advanced till he reached the home
plate, where he suddenly snatched the tattered blanket
from his shoulders, flaunted it round his head, and uttered
such a yell of victory that it was heard clear
and shrill and piercing above the roaring of the thousands
of spectators.</p>

<p>The piercing yell of the old Indian caused the shouting
spectators to grow silent, while they looked on in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
thrilled astonishment. As there came a hush the old
man cried:</p>

<p>“Heap big hard hit! Him mighty whiteskin chief!”
Then he ended with a most bloodcurdling war-whoop.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” brayed the stammering
fellow on the bleachers. “Didn’t I tell you he could
dud-dud-dud-do it! A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!”</p>

<p>When the rejoicing players lowered the hero of the
moment, the boy who had dashed out ahead of the
Indian sprang forward and grasped the jay’s hand.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d do it!” he said, his handsome face
glowing, while there was a look of pride in his eyes.
“Why, you can do anything! You can do everything!”</p>

<p>“Oh, not by a gosh-ding sight!” exclaimed the
countryman awkwardly. “I couldn’t keep a certain
gingery young colt from buckin’ over the traces oncet
on a time; but I kainder guess he won’t do it no
more.”</p>

<p>“Never!” declared the boy, something like a look
of shame coming to his face. “Oh, I was silly! Just
see what I would have missed had I gone away!”</p>

<p>Trueman took hold of the jay and drew him aside.</p>

<p>“See here, man!” he exclaimed, in repressed excitement;
“who are you, anyhow? Where did you
ever play?”</p>

<p>“Mud Crick, Slabtown, Suckerville, an’ other towns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
like that. Oh, I’ve got a reppertation where I’m
known! I tole yer I could do a thing ur two.”</p>

<p>“I believe you have saved this game!”</p>

<p>“Think very likely I hev,” was the cheerful answer.
“It would be jest like me.”</p>

<p>“If you can keep up this kind of work I’ll sign you
for the St. Paul team.”</p>

<p>“Git out!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Trueman, who did not wish the
stranger to “get his ideas up,” “you lack experience,
and, therefore, you cannot command much money;
but I’ll give you a chance to show what you can do,
and then we’ll talk about money matters.”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” laughed the jay. “Why,
mister, you don’t know how funny it is to hear you
talk that air way.”</p>

<p>Trueman flushed, wondering if the fellow was half-witted.</p>

<p>“Talk what way?” he asked.</p>

<p>“’Bout me lackin’ ’sperience, an’ such stuff as that.
But I don’t want to play perfessional baseball, anyhow,
an’ I jest stepped inter this game ter help ye
out. You can’t hire me.”</p>

<p>“But think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You ain’t gut money enough.”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars weekly and all expenses.”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!”</p>

<p>Again Trueman’s face reddened, for the note of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
derision in the laughter of the jay could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that enough?” asked the captain of the St.
Pauls.</p>

<p>“Be you the manager?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t make no kind of an offer, mister.
What be you talkin’ about?”</p>

<p>“I’m taking chances. I’ll bring round the manager.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no use. He ain’t gut money ernuff to hire
me.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I wouldn’t play perfessional baseball
fer two hundred dollars a week, and I mean
business when I say so. I’m jest doin’ this ter-day
fer the fun of the thing, an’&mdash;&mdash; Well, gol-dinged ef
that feller ain’t out!”</p>

<p>The next batter had been thrown out at first.</p>

<p>“Now do your handsomest,” urged Trueman. “If
you hold ’em down I’ll give you five dollars.”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” brayed the queer character.
“Don’t be so dinged generous. If you’d said
twenty-five it’d sounded better. I’ll do my best ter
hold ’em down, but you kin keep your old fiver in
your trousers.”</p>

<p>Then he walked out onto the diamond in the same
slouching, careless way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>Old Joe Crowfoot and Dick were now seated on
the St. Paul bench, having been placed there as mascots.
The savage had wrapped his dirty blanket
about his shoulders once more, and he was stoically
puffing away at a long black pipe. The boy, however,
was quivering with excitement, although he did his
best to repress it.</p>

<p>The work of the jay in that inning was something
amazing. First he called down the catcher for a bit
of private talk, and the catcher was heard to exclaim:</p>

<p>“What are you giving me! Impossible! It can’t
be done! Of course I can hold it!”</p>

<p>Then they went back to their positions, and the
first batter of the Minneapolis team was at the plate.</p>

<p>The first ball pitched by the jay amazed the batter,
for it started with a curve out, but seemed to change
its course and shoot in with amazing speed, crossing
the plate. The batter had not looked for anything
like that, and he stood with the bat lifted, letting the
ball pass. The catcher, for all of his little talk with
the pitcher, was unprepared, and the ball got past him,
after hitting his mitt.</p>

<p>“Strike!” gasped the umpire, who had a good eye,
but who seemed more astonished than anybody else.</p>

<p>“Thought you said you’d hold it!” exclaimed the
pitcher. “Put your fins on it and fasten ’em there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>The face of the catcher showed his chagrin, for all
of the cage he wore.</p>

<p>“Try it again,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, try it again!” growled the batter.</p>

<p>In the stand behind the catcher there was great excitement.
One man was wildly declaring that the ball
had curved like a wiggling snake, and several others
agreed with him, while yet others asserted that it was
an optical illusion.</p>

<p>The jay grinned as he pressed the ball into his
hand to deliver it again. He looked at the catcher
and nodded, and the catcher braced himself.</p>

<p>Then came another surprise, for the ball started with
an in curve that caused the batter to get back from
the plate, but it changed to an out and passed over
the plate fairly.</p>

<p>“Strike two!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>A great shout went up from the grand stand, where
many persons were excitedly telling each other that
the ball had curved both ways.</p>

<p>The catcher had managed to stop the second one,
although it fell from his mitt, but he was bewildered.</p>

<p>The batter started to kick, but the umpire quickly
closed him up.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” laughed the jay. “Tole
you folks I hed somethin’ hot up my sleeve. Don’t
believe you ever seen northin’ like that afore.”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” roared his friend on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
bleachers. “Now, you’re mum-mum-mum-making
mum-mum-mum-monkeys of ’em, old mum-mum-mum-man!”</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word, Joe,” returned the pitcher.
“Ain’t this the greatest fun you ever seen?”</p>

<p>“Bub-bub-bub-better’n a circus,” declared the chap
on the bleachers.</p>

<p>The batter was angry and bewildered. He was
looking for another of those peculiar twisting balls,
and, as a result, he fanned out when the jay put the
next one over the inside corner of the plate.</p>

<p>Then the strange pitcher and his stammering friend
“a-hawed” in unison, while the crowd shouted and
applauded.</p>

<p>“What sort of a wizard are we up against?” muttered
the captain of the Minneapolis team.</p>

<p>The catcher was on edge now, for he realized that
he was catching a pitcher who stood far ahead of any
one he had ever supported before.</p>

<p>The next batter was fooled quite as easily as the
first had been, fanning wildly at the first two balls and
then letting the third one pass, although it cut the
plate, and he was declared out on three strikes.</p>

<p>The third man was looking for something of the
same sort, and he was keyed to a high pitch to hit
speed, which caused him to swing far too soon when
the first ball came in dead slow, rocking in the air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
without turning, so that the stitches in the covering
could be distinctly seen.</p>

<p>“That’s my dope ball,” laughed the strange pitcher.
“Ain’t it a baby?”</p>

<p>Under his breath the batter swore and gripped his
bat. The stranger was “making monkeys” of the hitters
as fast as they came up to strike.</p>

<p>“That pitcher is worth five hundred dollars a month
to any team!” declared the pale-faced Minneapolis
man. “He must be some old-timer.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look very old,” said the dark-faced
man, who had confessed to having money bet on the
game. “It must be nothing but a streak of luck.”</p>

<p>These two men were well known in Western sporting
circles, the pale-faced man being Charley Bates,
who had inherited a million and lost it all in two years
of fast living, while the dark-faced one was Hank
Dowling, a notorious gambler and race-track man.</p>

<p>“How much do you stand to lose on this game if
St. Paul wins?” asked Bates.</p>

<p>“Eight hundred dollars,” answered Dowling.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you’re out that much.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. The score is tied, and there is another
show. We have our last half.”</p>

<p>“But St. Paul can’t touch that pitcher. Look at
that! He has two strikes on Gibson, and Gib is the
third man up this inning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“But that fellow may be fixed.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find a way.”</p>

<p>Then, as the jay pitcher struck the third man out
the crowd went wild, and somebody in the grand stand
yelled:</p>

<p>“Talk about Frank Merriwell’s double-shoot! Why,
here’s a man who can pitch all around Merriwell!”</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">THE JAY’S FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Now the manager of the St. Paul team got hold of
the jay and offered him all kinds of inducements to
finish the season with St. Paul. But the strange fellow
shook his head and said:</p>

<p>“Thankee kindly, mister, but I’m playin’ ball fer
my health. I’ve got more’n seventeen dollars ready
money on hand, an’ I don’t need no more.”</p>

<p>“You must be crazy!” exclaimed the manager. “I’ll
give you three hundred dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“Go ’way! Object ain’t no money to me, as a
friend of mine would say.”</p>

<p>“Why, confound you!” spluttered the manager; “I’ll
make it a hundred dollars a week and all expenses!”</p>

<p>“You’re wastin’ your breath, mister; a thousan’ dollars
a week wouldn’t hire me.”</p>

<p>The manager sat down, with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>“You must be a millionaire in disguise!” he exclaimed,
in deep disgust.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I be,” grinned the jay.</p>

<p>In the first half of the ninth St. Paul made a desperate
try to score and got a man to third by a base
on balls, a sacrifice, and a stolen base, but Webber<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
“put on steam” and retired the side with the runner
still on third.</p>

<p>Then Minneapolis came to bat, determined to get in
and do something. Stebson talked to his men.</p>

<p>“Bunt,” he said. “Get hit by the ball. Do anything
to get on first. It’s the only show. You can’t hit
this fellow out, but there must be a way to do something
with him.”</p>

<p>So the first man up pretended to try to dodge one
that came close to him, but dodged into the ball.</p>

<p>It nearly knocked a rib out of him, and he fell in
a heap.</p>

<p>“Take your base,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Bet four dollars he won’t jump inter another one
this game!” said the pitcher.</p>

<p>Trueman objected to giving the man his base, but
the umpire stood by his decision.</p>

<p>“Now, here’s where we start!” yelled the coacher,
as a runner took the place of the man who had been
hit. “Get a lead! Get off that bag! He can’t catch
you in a month!”</p>

<p>In fact, the jay seemed utterly careless of the man
on first, but he suddenly snapped his foot toward the
bag and threw at the same instant.</p>

<p>The ball was in the baseman’s hands almost instantly,
and he tagged the runner as the latter tried
to get back.</p>

<p>“Out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” roared the pitcher, and
like an echo came the braying laugh from the
bleachers.</p>

<p>“Balk! balk!” yelled the captain of the Minneapolis
team. “How is that for a balk, Mr. Umpire?”</p>

<p>“The man is out,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Now some other feller jump in front of the ball,”
invited the jay, as the uproar subsided.</p>

<p>But the next man lacked the courage to do so
when the sphere came whizzing across the plate, and
he went down in short order, striking out without
touching the ball.</p>

<p>The third man up managed to pop up a little fly,
which the jay took easily.</p>

<p>“He’s playing the whole game alone!” exclaimed
Charley Bates disgustedly.</p>

<p>Hank Dowling slipped down from the bleachers and
got near the bench of the visitors. As the jay came
in the gambler caught his eye and gave him a sign.
The jay came over, and the gambler grasped his hand,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“How are you, old man? Didn’t know you at first!
Why, you’re doing a slick turn to-day!”</p>

<p>Then, under his breath, he added:</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars if you throw the game!”</p>

<p>“Hey?” exclaimed the jay, suddenly pulling his
hand away.</p>

<p>“Two hundred!” breathed the gambler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“Why, you gol-dern skunk!” roared the pitcher.
“I’d good mind ter soak ye! You can’t buy me fer
two hundred thousan’ dollars!”</p>

<p>Then he loudly cried:</p>

<p>“Gents, this air critter has offered me two hundred
dollars to give ther game erway! What do ye think
of that?”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” instantly declared Dowling. “I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Biff! the hard fist of the jay struck Dowling on the
eye, and the man went backward.</p>

<p>“Don’t like ter strike a critter like that,” said the
strange pitcher; “but it’s agin’ my principles to have
him insult me by tryin’ ter buy me and then call me
a liar. If he’d jest called me a liar I wouldn’t minded
it much, comin’ from such a cheap dog, but ther hull
business went agin’ my grain.”</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried several voices, as Dowling rose,
hissing an oath. “He’s going to shoot!”</p>

<p>The man’s hand was at his hip, and he snatched
out a revolver. Before he could use the weapon, however,
the pitcher had his wrist in a grip of iron.</p>

<p>“You’re the blamedest skunk I ever seen!” grimly
declared the jay. “It’s goin’ to be a pleasure to kick
the liver out of ye!”</p>

<p>Then he gave the man’s wrist a wrench, forcing
him to drop the revolver, turned him round, and kicked
him hard enough to lift him clear of the ground.</p>

<p>But Dowling had a gang of friends close at hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and they made a scramble to get in. Within six seconds
the jay was surrounded by them, and his peril
seemed great, for they were ready to do him up.</p>

<p>“Put him out of the game!” panted Dowling.
“Smash him!”</p>

<p>Then through the crowd about the imperiled pitcher
came Dick. He was fierce as a young tiger in his
charge, and he hurled himself straight at a man who
was on the verge of striking the pitcher with a set
of brass knuckles.</p>

<p>Had that blow fallen the jay would have pitched
no more that day. As it was, the boy gave the man
a punch in the stomach that doubled him up and
caused him to fail in his dastardly attempt to “do up”
the pitcher.</p>

<p>Old Joe did not remain idle. For all of his years,
he followed the boy into the midst of the fray, and
his arms seemed strong as iron bars when he thrust
the thugs aside. From his lips came a shrill, piercing
yell that was the war-whoop of a red man entering
battle.</p>

<p>That was not all. From various points the crowd
saw eight young men, brown, beardless, clear-eyed
athletes, who leaped to take part in the struggle. One
of them was the tall, stuttering fellow who had “haw-hawed”
so much over the work of the pitcher, and
now he roared:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Gug-gug-give it to um! Knock the pup-pup-packin’
out of um!”</p>

<p>They seemed to be friends of the jay at the start,
and this they quickly showed was the case, for they
sailed into the thugs and knocked them right and
left.</p>

<p>It was a lively fight, but it did not last long.
Those young athletes made short work of the ruffians,
quickly putting them to flight.</p>

<p>Two officers hastened to take part, but not an arrest
did they make, for in the surge of the crowd
the attacking roughs got away.</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” laughed the jay pitcher.
“Why, this is a reg’ler hot old time! Ain’t seen so
much excitement sence I pitched for Slabtown agin’
Bugville. Thankee very kindly, gents, fer the nifty
way in which ye walked right up an’ took my part.
Now, we’ll continner the game, without further interruptions,
I hope.”</p>

<p>Hank Dowling had slipped away, but he took care
not to return to his former seat. In the rear of the
crowd he was joined by Bates, who said:</p>

<p>“I tried to get in, but I wasn’t quick enough, Hank.
The chap has some friends.”</p>

<p>“Devil take him!” grated Dowling. “He nearly
twisted my arm off! Why, he has the strength of
Sandow!”</p>

<p>“And he came out of it without a scratch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. He’s a fool, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s a mystery. I don’t believe he’s the fool he
looks.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t throw the game for two hundred!
What does he care about the game? What difference
does it make to him who wins? I say he’s a fool!”</p>

<p>“Money doesn’t seem to cut any ice with him.”</p>

<p>“No; and I reckon he’ll pull this game out for St.
Paul. I’ll lose my dough to-day; but I’ll get even
with that duffer if it costs me twice as much!”</p>

<p>St. Paul tried hard to get another run in the first
of the ninth, but the effort was useless. Minneapolis
was fighting for its very life, and no runner reached
third.</p>

<p>Then the visitors again took the field. Now the
manager sent the first batter up with instructions to
get his base on balls, anyhow, informing him that
he would be fined if he struck at a pitched ball.</p>

<p>The first three pitched were called balls by the umpire,
and it began to look as if the judgment of the
manager was good.</p>

<p>Then the jay put one straight over for a strike.
Another followed. The batter gripped his “slugger”
and seemed ready to hit.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it!” cautioned the manager, in a low
tone. “Let it go.”</p>

<p>The batter obeyed, and a swift one went straight
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>The trick had not worked, for the first man was
out.</p>

<p>“Bunt,” said the manager to the next man, “toward
third.”</p>

<p>The jay was grinning and the crowd shouting. The
pitcher gave the batter a straight one, thinking the
same trick might be again attempted. The batter
bunted as directed, and the ball rolled toward third.</p>

<p>The jay sprang for it, but the catcher rushed in and
bothered him. Had the catcher let the ball alone, it
seemed that the jay might have stopped the runner
at first. Getting the ball, the catcher started to throw,
but the pitcher caught his arm and held it.</p>

<p>“No good!” he said. “Let that critter go. Better
do that than ter make a bad throw.”</p>

<p>The catcher was angry, but Trueman declared his
judgment right.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the jay, in a low tone to the catcher,
“look out fer a bunt toward fust. It’s ther play.”</p>

<p>“Give him that double twist,” advised the catcher.</p>

<p>“Ef you let it git past ye that chap down to fust’d
git a sack ur two. I don’t dast to try it.”</p>

<p>The judgment of the jay was correct, for the next
hitter bunted toward first. Being prepared, the catcher
got the bunt, but the runner on first had obtained a
good start, and so it was impossible to stop him.
However, the batter was thrown out at first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Two were out, and the heavy hitter of the home
team came up.</p>

<p>“Drive in this run, Lermon,” directed the manager.</p>

<p>Lermon swung hard to put the ball out into the field
or drop it beyond the fence. He missed the first one
and fouled the next.</p>

<p>Then he put up a weak fly that was gathered in by
the pitcher, who did not move from his tracks.</p>

<p>“Another inning!” shouted the crowd.</p>

<p>The jay was laughing, and he looked up toward a
point on the bleachers where had gathered the eight
young men who hastened to his aid in the encounter
a short time before. They smiled at him, seeming
to enjoy the sport very much.</p>

<p>The first St. Paul batter drove an easy one to second
and was thrown out.</p>

<p>“Mister Manager,” said the jay, in a low tone, “if
you’ll ’scuse me, I’ll make a suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said the manager.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try the same trick t’other chaps
did? Make the next feller bunt to third.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was accepted, and the man succeeded
in getting in a good bunt that let him down
to first on a close decision.</p>

<p>Then once more the jay came up. As the queer,
awkward-looking chap advanced to the plate Old Joe
rose from the bench and uttered a cry that sounded
strange and weird and thrilling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Instantly from the friends who had aided the jay
in his encounter came a strange cheer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry wsp">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Breka Co ax, Co ax, Co ax!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breka Co ax, Co ax, Co ax!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">O&mdash;&mdash;up! O&mdash;&mdash;up!</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Parabalou&mdash;&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Yale! Yale! Yale!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">’Rah! ’Rah! ’Rah!</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Yale!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The jay smiled, and his face was transformed.
The foolish expression had vanished, and he seemed
positively handsome. In his general appearance a
most astonishing change had taken place. All his
awkward slouchiness had vanished, and now he was
straight and graceful, despite the clothes he wore.</p>

<p>The crowd looked on amazed, realizing something
was about to happen.</p>

<p>“Look at the jay!” gasped Trueman.</p>

<p>A hush fell on the spectators. Webber had seen
the change in the unknown pitcher, and it bewildered
him.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” commanded the umpire, as the Minneapolis
pitcher stood, with the sphere in his hand.</p>

<p>Then Webber swung his arm and put one right over
the heart of the plate.</p>

<p>The mysterious batter did not wait for another
one, but he picked that one out and smashed it hard
enough to make a dent in it.</p>

<p>The ball went out on a line clear of the reach of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
any infielder, and the runner ahead of the jay tore up
the dust as he scooted round the bases. Over second
he went, on to third, over third, and, while the
spectators rose up and howled, he came speeding
home.</p>

<p>The ball had been recovered, but, in his effort to
stop the run, the fielder threw wild. The mysterious
ball-player saw this, and he took a chance by keeping
on when he reached third base.</p>

<p>The pitcher got the ball on the line from home to
third, whirled and threw it to the waiting catcher.
The runner saw the catcher was slightly ahead of
the base-line. In order to deceive the fellow he ran
straight at him.</p>

<p>The catcher received the ball and swung to put it
onto the runner. Like a flash the fellow dodged,
ducked, and went under the catcher’s arm, flinging
himself across the plate.</p>

<p>The umpire’s gesture told the man was safe, but
his voice was not heard in the uproar that followed.</p>

<p>No wonder the St. Paul players went almost mad
with joy! No wonder they hugged the jay and lifted
him aloft as Old Joe again flaunted his red blanket
in the air and uttered that ear-piercing, heart-thrilling
yell!</p>

<p>The wonderful stranger was lifted a second time
on the shoulders of the admiring players, while men
on the bleachers stood up and waved hats, hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
canes in a tumultuous upheaval. In the grand stand
ladies fluttered their handkerchiefs and men shouted.</p>

<p>Not only was the St. Paul crowd thundering, but
others had joined in, having been won over by the
remarkable work of the unknown.</p>

<p>It was some moments before the cheering subsided
and the game could continue. Then, as the crowd
quieted down, the youthful friends of the wonderful
pitcher were heard singing. And this is the song they
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<span class="fs70">A CHALLENGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Dick hugged the mysterious ball-player when the
latter was lowered to the ground. The pitcher laughed
and asked:</p>

<p>“Is this better than the fun you used to have,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“It is better than anything!” palpitated the lad.
“It’s perfectly glorious.”</p>

<p>Then up in the grand stand a man rose and cried:</p>

<p>“Minneapolis, you have been taken in to-day! Take
a tumble to the trick! That jay is no jay at all! He’s
simply made up like a jay! He’s some king-pin off the
National League rung in on you!”</p>

<p>But up rose another man, who loudly declared:</p>

<p>“You’ve been fooled, all right, but he’s no professional.
He’s a college pitcher, and you ought to know
him by this time. Didn’t you hear his friends when
they cheered? Didn’t you hear them singing? Why,
I know who he is!”</p>

<p>“Who?” cried hundreds of voices.</p>

<p>“He’s Frank Merriwell!” declared the man.</p>

<p>A hush&mdash;then a cry of surprise rose to a shout of
wonder. Everybody present, it seemed, had heard of
Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>Was it possible this chap could be Merriwell in
disguise?</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry!” gasped Trueman, “I believe
that fellow is right!”</p>

<p>Then he jumped at the “jay,” demanding:</p>

<p>“Who are you? Is that man telling the truth?
Are you Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Well, by gum! what a question?” grinned the
strange pitcher. “How kin I be?”</p>

<p>“But you are!” asserted the captain of the St.
Paul team positively. “You’re no Rube!”</p>

<p>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!” laughed the fellow, slapping
his thigh and seeming greatly amused.</p>

<p>But the man in the grand stand cried again:</p>

<p>“He is Frank Merriwell, and those chaps on the
bleachers who cheered for him and sang are members
of his baseball-team.”</p>

<p>Up rose an apple-cheeked chap in the midst of the
group of young athletes on the bleachers. He looked
around with a radiant smile, flirted one hand with a
peculiar gesture that seemed to command silence, and
then clearly cried:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;and others: The Solomonlike
gentleman in the grand stand has made it
impossible to longer maintain the deception, and so
we are forced to admit that his eagle eye has penetrated
the disguise of our esteemed and honored captain.
Yonder Rube, with hayseed in his hair is in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
truth the only and original Frank Merriwell, who has
in his sleeve a few kinks and twists he has not ventured
to give the ball to-day. We, ladies and gentlemen,
are his humble followers, and we are modest
enough to confess that we regard him as the greatest
pitcher who ever came down the pike. Yea, verily,
even so! The choir will now chant an anthem.”</p>

<p>Then he sat down and the young men on the
bleachers loudly sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All hail to the chief who strikes out the batter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He puts the ball over the four-cornered platter;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then with the stick he’s ever quite handy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the game of baseball our Merry’s a dandy.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The delighted spectators cheered and applauded.</p>

<p>“This game isn’t over,” cried a Minneapolis man.
“We have another inning.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll never be able to make a run off that
pitcher,” retorted a fan from St. Paul.</p>

<p>“Oh, he can be hit!” flung back the other.</p>

<p>Webber had been given time to cool down, and
now he caused the next batter to put up an easy one.
The last man fanned, and the side was out. But the
lead secured by St. Paul seemed large in a game of
this sort.</p>

<p>As Merriwell walked out into the box he was given
an ovation by the spectators.</p>

<p>“That makes me sick!” muttered Stebson, captain
of the home team. “He’s nothing but an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
college pitcher. He’s had great luck to-day, but I
don’t believe he could keep the work up through nine
innings.”</p>

<p>“We made a mistake in letting them substitute him,”
said one of the players.</p>

<p>“But who’d thought he was anything much! He’s
a mighty clever actor.”</p>

<p>“I understand he was on the stage once.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for it.”</p>

<p>The captain of the home team did not propose to
give the game up. He declared there was a show to
win out, and the batters went up to strike under his
directions. He told them just what to do, and they
obeyed him.</p>

<p>Merry was at a disadvantage, for he did not have
his regular catcher. However, Frank worked the first
batter cleverly, the fellow being thrown out at first
on an easy hit to third.</p>

<p>The next one tried to bunt, but Merry had anticipated
the trick and kept the balls high. It is difficult
to bunt a high ball successfully, and two tries
resulted in two strikes. Then the fellow fanned and
struck out.</p>

<p>“The game is all over!” cried a St. Paul man.</p>

<p>Then up rose a Minneapolis man and shouted:</p>

<p>“It’s nothing but a streak of luck. We can beat a
team with that boy pitching for it nine times out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
ten. I’ll back Minneapolis to win against Frank Merriwell’s
own team.”</p>

<p>This created applause, and Merriwell laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing to have faith in your home
team,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Will you play us?” demanded the man.</p>

<p>“I should be delighted,” answered Frank, “but I
have to hear from your manager.”</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to strike the last batter out, and
the game was over.</p>

<p>“What do we owe you?” asked the manager of the
St. Pauls, as Merry walked in to the bench.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the answer. “I didn’t do this for
pay, but for the sport.”</p>

<p>“How can we thank you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to. I owe you thanks.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“The fun I’ve had.”</p>

<p>Merriwell’s friends rushed down and gathered
round him.</p>

<p>“Ye gods and little fish-hooks!” spouted Ready,
posing before Frank. “But you do look like a freak!
And to think this is the fastidious Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“Merry, you’re a dim-jandy!” spluttered Rattleton,
grasping Frank by the hand. “You’ve given us any
amount of fun!”</p>

<p>“More sport than I’ve had before in a month,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
rumbled Browning. “I can have lots of fun out of
baseball when I don’t have to play.”</p>

<p>“But I’m th-th-th-thundering mad!” stuttered Gamp
fiercely.</p>

<p>“What about?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“You mum-mum-mum-mocked my laugh,” said Joe.
“Gosh-ding if I didn’t think sometimes that I was
lul-lul-lul-laughin’ myself!”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t anybody else do the trick you did, Merry,”
said Hodge.</p>

<p>“It was better than a round-up,” nodded Berlin
Carson.</p>

<p>“Heap much big time!” put in Old Joe Crowfoot,
who had joined the group.</p>

<p>“Crowfoot,” said Frank, “you’re a mascot. You
hoodoo the other side when you utter that ear-splitting
war-whoop.”</p>

<p>“Dick him like for me to do um,” said the savage.</p>

<p>“And you will do anything for Dick,” said Merry,
resting a hand on the shoulder of the Indian who
had thrice attempted his life. “For that reason you
are my friend.”</p>

<p>The manager of the Minneapolis team pushed his
way into the group.</p>

<p>“You’re a rather clever chap, Merriwell,” he said,
with an angry sneer on his face. “We owe you something.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it!” smiled Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“But I have to mention it. We owe you a good
beating.”</p>

<p>“What sort? Same as those toughs tried to give
me?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s sore because they failed to get in
their work,” flared Hodge.</p>

<p>“Not that sort,” said the manager. “But you seem
to have a swelled head. You think you can’t be beaten.
The truth is that you had a big streak of luck to-day.”</p>

<p>“Do you count it luck?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do! Why, you struck out men the
best pitchers in this league cannot make fan.”</p>

<p>“They’d get used to that if they had to bat against
him right along,” said Jack Ready airily.</p>

<p>“They’d hammer him all over the lot in another
game!” exclaimed the manager.</p>

<p>“Oh, for another game!” sighed Jack.</p>

<p>“You shall have it if you dare play!” exclaimed
the manager. “We have an open date to-morrow, and
we’ll play you right here at three in the afternoon.
Do you dare accept?”</p>

<p>“I shall accept with great pleasure,” bowed Frank,
smiling.</p>

<p>“And we’ll trim you scientifically,” added Ready.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CHALLENGE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The morning papers contained accounts of the appearance
of the “jay pitcher” in the ball-game the
previous day and his final unmasking as Frank Merriwell.
While the papers were forced to confess that
his work in the box had been surprising, still not one
of the reporters seemed willing to credit him with
ability to keep it up. Some of them stated that his delivery
was puzzling to strange batsmen, but that almost
any hard-hitting team would be sure to fall
upon him heavily before a game was over.</p>

<p>This made Hodge angry and disgusted.</p>

<p>“Why is it,” said Bart, “that these newspaper duffers
always seem to think that college men are not as
fast as professionals? Professionals seldom play for
blood, as college men do.”</p>

<p>“But professionals do have the experience,” confessed
Merry. “Old leaguers make the best coaches
for college teams.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; but all the big teams are scouting
for college pitchers nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Pitchers are in demand always. Few college men,
however, play on league teams outside the pitcher’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
box. I see these papers think we’ll be easy for Minneapolis
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, they have another think coming to them.
You know the chap who tried to bribe you to throw
the game yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s betting all kinds of money on Minneapolis.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Belmont, the freshman I saved from getting a
thrashing last year, took me down to one of the sporting
clubs last night, and that fellow was there. His
name is Dowling, and he’s a gambler. He was looking
for bets, and he found lots of them. I should
imagine he shoved up a thousand on the game right
there.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>“If we win,” he said, “Mr. Dowling will be the
sorest sport in this town.”</p>

<p>“We’ll win,” nodded Hodge grimly. “I wouldn’t
lose the game for a thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“But we’ll have to play ball if they have another
pitcher like Webber.”</p>

<p>“I hear they are going to put their crack pitcher
against us.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Pink Potter.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“You know about him?”</p>

<p>“I know his record. He’ll be in the National next
season.”</p>

<p>“What has he done?”</p>

<p>“Shut out two of the leading teams this season
without a hit.”</p>

<p>“He can’t do it with us!”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“I know he can’t.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Frank, “we have not what would be
regarded as a hard-hitting team, and some of the
men are decidedly weak in their batting.”</p>

<p>“Slugging doesn’t win close games as a rule. I’ve
seen good bunting teams lose games by the foolishness
of their manager. Wanting a run or two, they
have been urged to ‘beef it out,’ which caused them
to fan.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Frank agreed, “but hitters are valuable
always.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to hold ’em down. A run or two may
be enough to win the game.”</p>

<p>Hodge did not permit his confidence to be shaken.
His faith in Frank was unbounded.</p>

<p>Merry watched his men closely, for he knew the
game on hand was certain to be difficult.</p>

<p>Dick was delighted over the prospect, but was dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>appointed
when he found Frank intended to put him
on the bench. The boy, despite his years, fancied he
could play in the game and be valuable.</p>

<p>When dinner-time came the boys all went down together,
having one large table in the dining-room.
Barely were they seated when Merry observed at a
near-by table the dark-faced gambler who had tried
to bribe him.</p>

<p>Dowling seemed to pay not the slightest attention to
Frank. He was talking to the colored waiter and
seemed ordering from the bill of fare.</p>

<p>The same waiter, with two others, afterward came
to wait on Frank’s table.</p>

<p>Merry took care in the choice of proper food for
each man, and he permitted none of them to have
coffee, which he regarded as a stimulant, but which
he was certain often made men heavy and lifeless in
the course of an hour or more after it was taken.</p>

<p>For himself, Merry ordered vichy water, and some
of the others took the same.</p>

<p>The boys were in good spirits, Jack Ready joking
and laughing after his usual manner. Even Greg
Carker was cheerful. This, however, Ready declared,
was a bad sign.</p>

<p>“Do you notice anything queer about the taste
of this vichy, Rattleton?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>Harry had a glass of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Rattles. “Don’t think
I do.”</p>

<p>“My taste may be off,” confessed Frank, “but it
seems odd to me.”</p>

<p>He did not drink more than half of what was placed
before him.</p>

<p>After dinner not one of the men was permitted to
smoke. Bruce groaned for his pipe, but Frank said
no, and that settled it.</p>

<p>By two o’clock the cars for the baseball-grounds
were crowded. It became evident that a great crowd
would turn out to the game.</p>

<p>It was two-thirty when Merriwell’s team appeared
on the field. They were greeted with cheers from the
spectators.</p>

<p>St. Paul had sent over a great throng of rooters
for Merriwell, his feat of the previous day having
won the admiration of the fans across the river.</p>

<p>Frank’s team was given the field first for practise.
Two men from the other team volunteered to bat.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell pulled on the catcher’s glove and
Merry started in to limber up a little. He was pale,
as Dick observed.</p>

<p>“Anything the matter?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>Merry started throwing easily and slowly, but several
times he stopped to brush a hand across his eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Twice after doing this he threw the ball far to one
side of Dick.</p>

<p>The boy was seized by a conviction that something
was wrong, but Frank would not say so.</p>

<p>Minneapolis put up faster practise than had Merry’s
team, and the spectators began to feel that the difference
in the two nines was so marked that the college
men had little show.</p>

<p>At last the hour for the game arrived, and the umpire
walked onto the diamond. Frank’s team was sent
to bat first.</p>

<p>“Start it right off, Jack,” advised Frank, as Ready
picked out a bat. “A good start means a lot.”</p>

<p>For once in his life, at least, Ready was not smiling
when he advanced to the plate. The line-up of the
teams was as follows:</p>

<p>Ready waited well, but Potter started out with good
control, and he forced Jack to swing at last. The
ball was hit, but it popped up into the air, and the
short-stop gathered it in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Carson walked out, met the first one “on the nose,”
and drove it like a bullet into the hands of Potter.
The pitcher muffed the ball, but picked it up in time
to throw Berlin out at first.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” cried Prince. “How easy they
are!”</p>

<p>Both men had hit the ball, however, and Frank
felt encouraged.</p>

<p>“He isn’t so hard, Hodge,” said Frank. “A little
single will start the thing going.”</p>

<p>Hodge let the first one pass. It was a high ball, but
it turned into a drop, and the umpire declared a strike.</p>

<p>The next one was an out, and it was called a ball.</p>

<p>Then came one close to Bart’s fingers, and he
missed it. The second strike was called.</p>

<p>Potter “worked the limit,” but Hodge made him
put it over. Then Bart drove out a fly that was taken
by Bryant, and the first three batters had been retired
in order.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">A BAD BEGINNING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When Frank rose from the bench to go into the
box he was seized by a queer sensation at the pit of
the stomach, and there seemed to be a blur before
his eyes.</p>

<p>“What ails me?” was the thought that passed
through his mind.</p>

<p>Then he heard a laugh that caused him to turn and
look toward the grand stand, brushing his hand across
his eyes. There in the stand sat Hank Dowling and
Charley Bates. The dark-faced gambler was laughing
and looking straight at Merry.</p>

<p>In that moment a feeling of suspicion assailed him.
Somehow it seemed that the grinning rascal in the
stand was responsible for the feeling of giddiness
that had attacked Merry.</p>

<p>“Foolish!” muttered Frank. “It can’t be.”</p>

<p>Yet at that moment Dowling was saying to Bates:</p>

<p>“Look at him! He staggered a bit when he got
up. The stuff is getting in its work.”</p>

<p>“You’re a dandy!” exclaimed the opium fiend admiringly.
“But I don’t understand how you got the
stuff into him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“Know Pete, the cross-eyed waiter, down at the
hotel where those chaps are stopping?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I got Pete out of a bad scrape last winter
when he was arrested for cutting a man.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He said he’d do anything for me. I haven’t
wanted to use him till to-day.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“I dined there. I called on Pete to doctor Merriwell’s
vichy water, which he ordered. I gave him the
stuff to do the trick, and he did it. Merriwell must
have tasted something wrong in the water, for he
drank only half a glass. That was enough, though.”</p>

<p>“You think he won’t be able to pitch?”</p>

<p>“If he is able, they’ll hammer him all over the lot.
I stand to win two thousand to-day.”</p>

<p>“And, having taken your advice, I have my last
blooming dollar on the game. If we don’t win, I’m in
the soup.”</p>

<p>“We’ll win. Watch Merriwell. Bryant will begin
with a hit.”</p>

<p>Frank stood in the box, while Bryant came up to
the plate. Twice he passed a hand across his eyes.
Then he looked for Bart’s signal, nodded, and delivered
the ball.</p>

<p>Bryant met the very first one with a smash that sent
out a clean single.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“I told you!” laughed Dowling quietly. “I knew
what would happen!”</p>

<p>Merry muffed the ball when it was thrown in.</p>

<p>“Get ready for the slaughter!” cried Prince, as
Jones came up.</p>

<p>Merry hesitated, accepted the signal, then pitched
the ball wild and Bryant went to second on it. The
spectators were amazed. They could scarcely believe
this was the same fellow who had, disguised as a jay,
done such work for St. Paul the day before.</p>

<p>“He’ll steady down in a moment,” said many.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell was filled with alarm, for he plainly
saw something was the matter with Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s sick!” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>Then Merry put a ball over and Jones smashed it
out for two bags, bringing Bryant in with a run.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s going to be a regular snap!” cried Prince.</p>

<p>“Looks like a skinch,” muttered Ready, to himself.
For once in his heedless life Jack was extremely worried
and betrayed it.</p>

<p>“Use the double, Merry,” he urged.</p>

<p>Stebson was up, and Frank signed that he would
start with the double-shoot.</p>

<p>Then Merry sent one into Stebson’s ribs, and the
captain of the Minneapolis team walked.</p>

<p>Bart came down to speak to Merry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“Something,” confessed Frank; “but I think I’ll be
all right in a minute.”</p>

<p>Hardy walked up with a barrel of confidence.</p>

<p>Again Frank tried the double-shoot, but he did
not make it curve both ways, and Hardy drove it far
into right field.</p>

<p>Jones and Stebson both came in, and Hardy took
second on the throw to stop Stebson from scoring.</p>

<p>“Oh!” shouted the crowd, in disgust.</p>

<p>Corday was eager, and Merry managed to force
him into putting up a high fly, which was gathered
by Gamp in deep center.</p>

<p>Hardy attempted to make third after the fly was
caught, but Joe lined the ball straight into Ready’s
hands, and Jack tagged the runner out. Two men
were retired.</p>

<p>Prince waited till Frank gave him a good one, and
then he singled safely.</p>

<p>Hodge was calling for the double-shoot, but Frank
could not use it. In truth, Merry could scarcely see
the batter, save in a blur.</p>

<p>Rafferty laughed at Merry as he came to the plate.
Then he hit the first one into right field, where Carker
pulled it down, after a hard run.</p>

<p>Three men were out at last, but the home team
had made three scores and Merry had been hit hard.</p>

<p>Dick met Frank when he came in to the bench, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Merry simply shook his head, without saying a word.
As he did so, Frank heard that triumphant laugh in
the grand stand, but the blur before his eyes did not
permit him to locate the exultant rascal.</p>

<p>Merry would answer no questions, but he spoke in
a low tone to Dick.</p>

<p>“Warm up,” he said.</p>

<p>The boy understood. He was to go into the box
against Minneapolis.</p>

<p>His heart leaped and then sank. For a moment he
grew pale, and then he asked for a ball. A moment
later Dick and Bart were moving out to a place where
the boy could warm up.</p>

<p>The spectators did not realize what it meant, for not
one of them imagined that the slender boy would be
sent against the heavy-batting leaguers.</p>

<p>Gamp came up and made a fierce try for a hit, which
dropped the ball in the hands of an outfielder.</p>

<p>Browning seemed dispirited, for he fanned three
times on the first three balls pitched.</p>

<p>Swiftwing fouled repeatedly and then struck out.</p>

<p>Again Merriwell’s men had been retired in order.</p>

<p>As the home team came in from the field something
surprising happened.</p>

<p>Out from the dressing-rooms came a most fantastic
figure. It was an old savage, dressed in the feathers
and finery so loved by his people, and painted in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
most hideous manner. Straight toward the home plate
he advanced.</p>

<p>“Look at that!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“An Indian!”</p>

<p>“It’s a joke!”</p>

<p>These exclamations came from the astonished spectators.</p>

<p>“It’s Old Joe!” breathed Dick Merriwell. “What
is he going to do?”</p>

<p>No one interfered with the old redskin, but all waited
and watched to see what he was about to do.</p>

<p>When he was about four feet from the home plate
the old fellow halted and extended his hands, while
his painted face was uplifted. Thus he stood for several
seconds. Then he began moving round the plate
in a circle, gradually increasing his pace and changing
his step to a dance. From his lips came a low,
weird sound that was like a song, and it grew louder
and louder as he continued the dance.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular war-dance!” exclaimed Jack Ready.
“So help me, Joseph is doing this to give us strength
in battle!”</p>

<p>Thus, singing a strange battle-song, which grew
louder and louder, Old Joe did a wild war-dance round
the home plate.</p>

<p>No one interrupted the old fellow, for all were interested
in the singular performance. A few small boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
hooted and whooped, while many laughed; but to nothing
of this sort did the Indian pay the least attention.</p>

<p>Crowfoot’s movements quickly became fierce and
violent, till it seemed most amazing that a man of his
years could go through them. His singing was a
shriek, and then, of a sudden, it stopped. With heaving
breast, the painted fellow turned and walked toward
the bench of the visiting players.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell was standing there, and straight
to the boy advanced the Indian. Dick met him, and
the old savage grasped the hand of the lad.</p>

<p>After looking into Dick’s eyes, the Indian lifted his
face skyward and uttered a yell that startled and
amazed many who heard it. It was the confident war-cry
of his tribe, and it meant that he felt sure of victory.</p>

<p>When this yell had pealed from his lips, Old Joe
lightly touched Dick on the cheeks and forehead, following
which he struck the boy a sharp blow on both
his right and left arm.</p>

<p>“Go!” he said. “Heap much strong to beat!”</p>

<p>Then Merriwell’s team went onto the field, Dick entering
the box.</p>

<p>Hank Dowling laughed his satisfaction, softly,
grimly.</p>

<p>“Look at that, Charley!” he said. “See the kid they
have been forced to put in Merriwell’s place.”</p>

<p>“They’ll kill that boy in one inning,” asserted Bates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“Why, it’s foolishness to put him against such sluggers
as our men are!”</p>

<p>“Worse than foolishness! They will bat his eyes
out. I’ve made a good thing to-day and evened up
with Merriwell for what happened yesterday.”</p>

<p>Hicks, the first batter, stepped out to the plate, looking
sympathetically at Dick.</p>

<p>“Too bad, kid,” he said. “I hate to do it, but I’ve
got to fat my batting-average to-day.”</p>

<p>Dick made no reply. He took the signal from Bart
and prepared to pitch. Hodge had called for the boy’s
remarkable jump ball at the very start.</p>

<p>Dick sent it in with considerable speed, and, still
laughing, Hicks tried to meet it.</p>

<p>The ball seemed to jump right over his bat!</p>

<p>“That’s queer!” exclaimed the striker. “Should
have hit that on the nose.”</p>

<p>“Why, he couldn’t hit you in a year!” came from
Ready.</p>

<p>“It’s a snap, Dick,” spoke Rattleton.</p>

<p>“Dead easy,” grunted Browning.</p>

<p>“Put it right over,” advised Carson.</p>

<p>Dick prepared to deliver the ball again, but now, to
the surprise of the batter, he changed his position so
that he seemed ready to pitch left-handed.</p>

<p>In came the ball, but it seemed wide of the plate.
It curved inward, however, and cut the outside corner.</p>

<p>“Strike two!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>The batter had not offered at it, and he was angry,
but the umpire quickly stopped a kick.</p>

<p>Then the boy changed back again and delivered the
ball with his right hand, again resorting to the jump
ball, which caused Hicks to fan.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the crowd.</p>

<p>“The kid struck him out!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!”</p>

<p>“He pitches with either hand!”</p>

<p>“Hicks thought him too easy.”</p>

<p>“Potter will get a hit.”</p>

<p>The crowd was talking excitedly as the pitcher
for the Minneapolis team walked up to the plate. Hicks
growled as he retired to the bench.</p>

<p>“Think of being struck out by that baby!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Potter was determined to show what he could do.
He batted left-handed, and immediately Dick prepared
to deliver the ball with his left hand.</p>

<p>The remarkable boy could throw with either hand,
and, of late, he had been practising pitching with
his left hand. To his surprise, he had found he could
get greater curves with his left than with his right,
but his control was not quite as good, while his speed
was much less.</p>

<p>The first ball pitched to Potter was very wild, but
Dick took pains with the next one, and sent a drop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
over. Potter fouled it, and his friends told him he
would meet the next one. He did not, however, and
Dick got two strikes on him very quickly.</p>

<p>Then, as Hodge called for the jump ball, the boy
changed about and threw with his right hand.</p>

<p>The ball looked like one straight over, and Potter
went after it. It rose clear of his bat and landed
safely in Bart’s mitt.</p>

<p>“Striker out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>“Ah!” shouted the witnesses, amazed because the
slender lad had fanned two of the home team.</p>

<p>But now up came Bryant, regarded as the best single
hitter on the Minneapolis team. Dick seemed to try
to “pull” him, but the batter was a great waiter, and
three balls without a strike were called on the youthful
pitcher.</p>

<p>“Nobody walks!” exclaimed Ready.</p>

<p>“Put it straight over,” advised Carson.</p>

<p>“Let him hit it,” from Rattleton.</p>

<p>“We’ll get him,” rumbled Browning.</p>

<p>Bart felt certain Bryant’s training would compel
him to wait, and so he signed for one straight over.</p>

<p>Dick obeyed. The ball whistled, and it cut the
home plate in two even pieces.</p>

<p>“Strike!”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Carson. “He’ll have to
hit it!”</p>

<p>Again Dick drove the ball straight over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Strike two!”</p>

<p>“Oh, lul-lul-lul-let him hit it!” cried Gamp, from
center field. “I want to warm up.”</p>

<p>Bart called for the rise.</p>

<p>Dick grasped the ball for the jump, on which he
put his greatest reliance. In vain he had practised
and worked to acquire the double-shoot, but, while
thus employed, he had learned how to throw the jump
ball, which seemed quite as effective as the double-shoot.</p>

<p>When the boy sent the ball in it seemed another
one straight over. Bryant did not try to “kill it,” but
he swung to meet the sphere and line it out.</p>

<p>The ball gave that queer jump, and he did not touch
it at all.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>Then the crowd uttered a roar, for this slender lad
struck out the first three men to face him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that?” yelled a man.
“Why, he’s just as good as Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“Hanged if I don’t believe he’s better!” cried another.</p>

<p>“Who is he? Who is he?” was the question that
went from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>Somebody found out.</p>

<p>“He’s Frank Merriwell’s brother!”</p>

<p>This information caused a great buzzing in the
crowd, and interest in Dick grew apace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>Feeling sick and giddy, Merry had sat on the bench
and endeavored to keep track of what was taking
place. Although he had great confidence in his brother,
he was fearful that Dick might not prove equal to
the emergency. It was a hard place to put a lad of
so few years and so little experience.</p>

<p>But Merry was satisfied when he found that Dick
had thus easily disposed of three batters.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Old Joe, who was sitting on the
bench in all his painted glory. “Heap big snap!”</p>

<p>“Good boy!” said Merry, as Dick came in. “You’re
a brother worth having.”</p>

<p>Up in the grand stand two men were talking.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Hank?” exclaimed
Bates.</p>

<p>“Luck!” retorted Bates. “Nothing but luck. They’ll
pound his eye out next inning.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“Of course they will! How can they help it? He’s
nothing but a kid.”</p>

<p>“But they say he’s Frank Merriwell’s brother.”</p>

<p>“What of that?”</p>

<p>“These Merriwells are hard to beat.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you? Are you squealing?”</p>

<p>“No, but I feel like hedging. Trouble is I haven’t
a dollar to hedge with.”</p>

<p>“You would be a fool to hedge! That boy isn’t
strong enough to last a whole game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“But I’m stripped if we lose&mdash;and you’ll be to
blame!”</p>

<p>“Your nerve is failing.”</p>

<p>But, in spite of his placid outward appearance, Hank
Dowling was not quite easy. Being a gambler, he was
nothing if not superstitious, and the appearance of the
old redskin on the field had filled him with strange
forebodings.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE GREAT HIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a great game after the bad first inning. Up
to the eighth neither side made any further scores.
In the last of the eighth, however, through wildness,
Dick gave the first man up a base on balls. The next
batter sacrificed the runner to second. Then Dick
gave another bag. On top of that, the next hitter
batted one to Ready, who fumbled it long enough to
fill the bags.</p>

<p>Only one man was out.</p>

<p>Then up from the bench rose Frank Merriwell. In
the midst of the game he had been very sick, but now
his brain seemed clear and his hand felt steady. Into
the diamond he walked, and Dick walked out.</p>

<p>The crowd shouted.</p>

<p>“Remember how they hit him in the first inning!”
“It’s all over now!” “They’ll make a dozen!” “Move
back your outfielders!”</p>

<p>Frank took the ball and looked at Bart, who gave
a sign. Merry shook his head, and assumed a position
that indicated he was about to use the double-shoot.</p>

<p>Every man on the field knew what was coming.
The batter, however, was not prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Whiz!&mdash;that strangely twisting ball went over the
pan.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>Bart smiled grimly as he returned the ball.</p>

<p>Whiz&mdash;again came the double-shoot, but with
curves reversed.</p>

<p>The batter swung hard, missed, fell down.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>Bart Hodge showed his teeth. This was Merriwell
in form. The speed was enough to make the ball burn
through the big catching-mitt.</p>

<p>“Pretty, Merry&mdash;pretty!” said Bart.</p>

<p>The batter got up, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Merry knew he had the fellow on the string, and
so he used a high, straight ball. The fellow went
after it, and fanned.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” cried somebody in the crowd.
“That’s the way he pitched yesterday! Now he is
getting into gear!”</p>

<p>The next batter had his teeth set, but Merry used
the double-shoot with the same deadly effect. Three
times the fellow fanned, and the side was retired.</p>

<p>Minneapolis had not scored after getting the bags
filled with only one out.</p>

<p>“Heap big stuff!” came from Old Joe, as Merry
walked in to the bench.</p>

<p>“Who is the hitter?” asked Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“I’m the first man,” said Browning.</p>

<p>“Get hit by the ball if you can,” commanded Merry.
“If you can’t, then get your base on balls. Make believe
you are anxious to line it out, but do not hit.”</p>

<p>Bruce groaned, for he was anxious to hit. Merry,
however, had found that any one who waited stood a
good show of getting a base off Potter, who had
grown wild as the game advanced.</p>

<p>Browning went up to the plate, and two strikes
were called on him without delay. Then he looked
at Merry for permission to hit, but Frank grimly shook
his head.</p>

<p>The next one looked close, but the umpire called it
a ball. Then Potter tried an out, but that was a ball.
A high one followed, and three balls had been called.</p>

<p>Now Bruce expected a straight one over the center,
and again he besought permission to hit it out. Again
Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>Potter tried to put one right over, but he failed,
and the umpire called four balls.</p>

<p>“Oh, Laura!” squealed Jack Ready, as he waltzed
down to the coaching-line by first. “Here is where
we win the bun!”</p>

<p>“Make him get them right over,” said Frank, as
Swiftwing picked out a bat. “Don’t go after high
ones.”</p>

<p>The young Indian was cool enough when he walked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
up to the plate, and he smashed the second one toward
first, but just inside the line.</p>

<p>The first baseman got the ball while Browning
was racing for second. Fortunately, Bruce had a big
start. As it was, he would not have reached second
had not the baseman dropped the ball thrown by
Prince after putting Swiftwing out at first. But Bruce
was safe on second, and one man was out.</p>

<p>Frank knew Rattleton stood little show of getting
a hit, and so he said:</p>

<p>“Get your base on balls.”</p>

<p>Harry stood up and pretended to be ready to hit,
but did not swing. Four balls were called.</p>

<p>Carker came next.</p>

<p>“Get your base on balls,” said Merry grimly.</p>

<p>Carker did not reply.</p>

<p>The first one was over for a strike. Then came a
ball. Then another ball. But a strike followed, and
Carker’s show looked poor.</p>

<p>Potter tried a very high one, and Greg came near
swinging.</p>

<p>“Three balls!” decided the umpire.</p>

<p>Frank rose from the bench, a bat in his hand.</p>

<p>“Do not strike at the next one, Carker,” he plainly
said. “If it cuts the plate in two, let it pass.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Potter was anxious. He knew another
ball would fill the bases. Although he was aware that
the batter would not strike, he was altogether too anx<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>ious
to get the ball across, and he failed to find the
plate.</p>

<p>“Take your base!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>The spectators shouted. The bases were filled, and
up to the plate stepped Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>Now was the time to win.</p>

<p>Charley Bates was paler than usual, while Hank
Dowling, for all of his nerve, did not look quite easy.</p>

<p>Potter began to fancy that everybody on the other
team intended trying to walk. That caused him to
put the first ball right over for Merriwell.</p>

<p>It was just where Frank wanted it. He met it
fairly, and away sailed the sphere.</p>

<p>For a moment the runners held their bases, and then
a great roar went up:</p>

<p>“It’s over the fence!”</p>

<p>In right field the fence was shorter than elsewhere,
and Merry had picked out that point, driving the ball
hard to put it over.</p>

<p>It was over!</p>

<p>Round the bases to the home plate came man after
man, while the grand stand and bleachers thundered.
As Merry came trotting down from third, Old Joe
Crowfoot rose and added his shrill shriek of joy to
the clamorous uproar.</p>

<p>That home run had placed Frank’s team one score
in the lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Dick Merriwell danced with delight, laughing and
shouting.</p>

<p>What did it matter if Jack Ready followed with a
pop-fly and was out? What though Carson failed to
hit the ball at all and the side was retired?</p>

<p>Merry went into the box again, and before him
fell the best hitters of the home team. They could do
absolutely nothing with his double-shoot.</p>

<p>Merry had won the game with his home-run hit
over the fence in the first of the ninth.</p>

<span class="fs70">DICK THRASHES A BULLY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“There he is!”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Standing on the steps.”</p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“The handsome fellow in the dark-blue suit.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tackle him.”</p>

<p>Nick Robinson, manager of the Philadelphia Athletic
baseball-team, stepped quickly toward the Continental
Hotel, in front of which Frank Merriwell was
chatting with Jack Ready.</p>

<p>Merriwell and his friends had reached the Quaker
City, and the entire party was stopping at the Continental.</p>

<p>As Robinson approached, he heard Jack Ready observing:</p>

<p>“It’s ever Sunday in this village, but whisper it not
to the natives, unless you desire their everlasting and
undying aversion. This is a perfectly lovely town to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
rest in, as nothing ever happens here to disturb the
Sabbath calm of the place.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t mind kicking up a little excitement,
to vary the monotony,” said Frank. “Now, if
we could get into a game of baseball, we might be
able to raise the dust.”</p>

<p>“That’s your cue, Nick,” muttered Jack Wilder, who
had followed Robinson closely.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, young men,” spoke the baseball
magnate; “are you Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” admitted Merry.</p>

<p>“And you are looking for a chance to play baseball?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly looking for a chance, though I’d like
to indulge in a little sport of the sort if I could find
a team that desired to play mine.”</p>

<p>“You have your team here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen newspaper accounts of your success in
defeating everything you have encountered this season,
and I have a team that I fancy is able to take
some of the conceit out of you.”</p>

<p>“What, ho!” cried Ready. “I scent trouble! Methinks
the fur will fill the breeze directly.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>“You, sir,” he said quietly, “are like others I have
encountered during our trip, for you fancy I must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
conceited because I have been very successful in defeating
fast ball-teams this season. We are out for
sport, sir, and are not afraid to tackle anything that
we come across. At the same time, I hardly think we
are conceited.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid of anything?”</p>

<p>“Afraid? Why should I be?”</p>

<p>“Then I challenge you to play my team to-morrow.
Do you accept?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure. What team do you represent?”</p>

<p>“He’ll want to back out when you tell him,” laughed
Wilder, with a sneering expression.</p>

<p>“Tut! tut!” came from Ready. “He won’t care a
sour clam what old team the gentleman represents.
The warmer the team the better it will suit Mr. Merriwell.
Are we going against National Leaguers?”</p>

<p>“I am the manager of the Philadelphia Athletic
team,” said Robinson proudly. “It happens that we
have an open date to-morrow. Of course, we’ll find
no trouble in defeating your team, Merriwell; but
there seems to be a foolish impression here that your
picked nine of college chaps must be much faster than
it possibly can be, and several sporting men in town
have hinted that you could give us a hard rub. One
man offered to bet me even money that you could hold
the Athletics down to five scores, or less. Now, that
is perfectly ridiculous. Seeing by the papers that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
had struck town and were stopping here, I decided
to look you up and find out if you had sand enough to
give us a game to-morrow. Mr. Wilder knows you
by sight, and that is why I brought him along. He
pointed you out to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad you took the trouble,” said Frank.
“I was beginning to fear that this city would not
provide us with amusement. What terms are you willing
to play on?”</p>

<p>“Winning team takes all the gate-money.”</p>

<p>“That is agreeable; but you are to do all the advertising
and provide balls and grounds.”</p>

<p>“We’ll play on the Athletic grounds, and I will look
out for everything. All you have to do is to be on
hand to begin playing at half-past three to-morrow.
Can I depend on you?”</p>

<p>“You may.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not lose your nerve and back out?”</p>

<p>“Say!” broke in Ready indignantly, “did you ever
know Merry to lose his nerve and back out of anything?
Go hence with thy base insinuations! He’ll
be on hand, with the crowd, to give you a hot run for
the gate-money. And I’ll bet you a peck of sweet
potatoes that we beat you! Dost dare take me?”</p>

<p>“There is conceit for you, Mr. Merriwell!” laughed
Robinson. “If you are not troubled with it, your
friend is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, nay, gentle stranger,” denied Jack, with a
queer flirt of his hand; “I deny thy allegation. It is
not conceit, but it is confidence. The two words are
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'hardly synonomous'">hardly synonymous</ins>.”</p>

<p>“Call it what you like, we’ll take it out of you to-morrow,”
nodded Robinson.</p>

<p>“Wait,” from Frank. “How am I to know that
this deal is on the level? I am not anxious to run
into any April-fool business.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll step inside with me,” said Robinson, “I
think we’ll find somebody to identify me and convince
you that my word is good. We can also draw up
agreements in regard to the gate-money.”</p>

<p>Merry at once agreed, and they entered the office of
the hotel. The proprietor happened to be in the office,
and he readily assured Frank that Robinson was the
manager of the Athletic team and that his word was
good. Then an agreement was drawn up, which both
Robinson and Frank signed, with the proprietor and
Ready as witnesses.</p>

<p>Ready was holding in repression his feeling of satisfaction
and delight, for this was just the sort of game
Jack longed to get into.</p>

<p>When everything had been arranged satisfactorily,
Robinson suggested that all adjourn to the bar and
“take something.” He was surprised and offended, at
first, when Frank declined with politeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“I do not drink,” explained Merry. “Of course, if
you insist, I’ll take a plain seltzer, or something of
that sort, with you.”</p>

<p>“You can take a cigar,” said Robinson.</p>

<p>“I’d have to give it away if I did.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you do not smoke?”</p>

<p>“I never have.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! It would be better for most ball-players
if they followed your example. Drinking has
ruined lots of promising young fellows. I’ve seen
fast young players go steadily down-hill from no apparent
cause, but investigation has revealed that they
were drinking right along. They fancied they could
do it because they knew some old stagers who did,
and they were careful not to take enough to become
intoxicated. Often they would have a drink before
a game. Then it seemed, when they got warmed up,
that the stuff went to their heads and muddled them
somehow so they could not do their best. I’ve warned
many of them in vain. They would insist that they
did not take enough to hurt them, and so they kept on
till they were released.”</p>

<p>“But some men who drink are fast players,” broke
in Wilder. “I know more than one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that may be,” nodded Robinson; “but they
would be still faster if they took nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“Exactly my belief,” asserted Frank. “And no man
can have good wind if he smokes persistently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>So, without drinking or smoking, they sauntered out
of the office to the steps of the hotel, where Merry had
first been observed by the men.</p>

<p>As they reached the steps their attention was drawn
to a shouting, whooping band of urchins who were
following at the heels of Old Joe Crowfoot.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Frank. “Here seems to be some
excitement.”</p>

<p>With a dirty red blanket wrapped about his shoulders,
the old Indian came stalking along Chestnut
Street, followed by a crowd of whooping boys of every
size and age. He paid not the slightest attention to
the urchins, but walked with all the dignity he could
command, his thin lips pressed together and his black
eyes gleaming like the eyes of an aroused animal.</p>

<p>The boys were led by one big, hulking fellow, who
was at least eighteen years old, and who looked very
tough and fierce. This chap was smoking a cigarette,
and had his soiled cap pulled down over one eye. He
walked with the gait of a prize-fighter, his neck thrust
forward and his chin protruding, while his shoulders
were hunched. Now and then he would turn and incite
the yelling boys to louder outbreaks of ridicule and
derision.</p>

<p>“What do me eyes behold?” exclaimed Jack Ready.
“The noble red man hath encountered a few samples
of the real uncivilized civilization. I see he is enjoying
it greatly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing in the world could make Joe so furious
as to be mocked by boys.”</p>

<p>As Merry spoke, the aged Indian suddenly stopped
and turned on his pursuers.</p>

<p>“Dogs!” he said, in great scorn, yet without lifting
his voice.</p>

<p>“Hey?” cried the leader of the young thugs, clenching
his fists, striking a pose, and thrusting his face toward
that of the redskin. “Wot’s dat yer calls us?”</p>

<p>“Dogs!” repeated Old Joe Crowfoot.</p>

<p>“W’y, yer dirty old tan-colored mucker! How dare
yer call us dat? Yer rotten old scalp-lifter! we’ll
knock seventeen kinds of stuffin’s out of yer!”</p>

<p>The expression on the wrinkled face of the old
savage was one of unspeakable scorn.</p>

<p>“Dogs! Buzzards! Squaws!” he flung back.</p>

<p>“Give it ter him, Jim!” cried the boys. “T’ump him,
Jim!”</p>

<p>The young thug lifted his clenched fist and shook
it under the nose of the old redskin.</p>

<p>“Take it back!” he snarled. “Swaller yer words,
ur I’ll smash yer!”</p>

<p>“Smash him! smash him!” howled the urchins.</p>

<p>“Look out fer his tommyhawk!” shrieked one.</p>

<p>“An’ his scalpin’-knife!” put in another.</p>

<p>Old Joe folded his arms across his breast, making a
picturesque figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“Yelping curs!” he said. “Heap no good! Dirt
under my feet! I spit on you!”</p>

<p>“Now I will soak yer!” roared the fellow called Jim,
as he swung his fist back.</p>

<p>Before the blow could fall a lithe figure sprang
down the steps of the hotel, darting past Frank Merriwell,
rushed forward, and jumped between the Indian
and the young thug, hurling the latter backward.</p>

<p>“You onery whelp!” exclaimed a clear, fearless
voice. “If you try to touch Old Joe, I’ll make you
sorry!”</p>

<p>“Behold!” said Jack Ready; “another Merriwell hath
chipped into the game, and verily I predict that the
fur will fly.”</p>

<p>Frank had started forward to interfere between the
Indian and his tormentors, but he paused now, something
like a grim smile coming to his handsome face
as he watched his brother thrust the city ruffian backward.</p>

<p>Dick was developing rapidly under the training of
Frank, who worked systematically with the lad,
strengthening his weak points and improving the
strong ones. Nor had Merry failed to give Dick instructions
in the manly art of self-defense. Each day,
when possible, he had spent at least thirty minutes
sparring with the lad, and the progress made by his
pupil had amazed Merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s gently sift into this scrap,” urged Ready.
“The wrinkled aborigine must be defended.”</p>

<p>Merry grasped his arm.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he advised. “Let’s see how Dick can handle
himself.”</p>

<p>Of course, the hooting urchins had gathered a
crowd, but somehow it happened that no officer appeared
to be in sight, therefore the hoodlums were not
dispersed.</p>

<p>The bully gave a gasp of surprise and anger as the
clean-faced lad with the flashing black eyes thrust him
backward. He staggered and nearly fell down, but
recovered quickly and gave Dick a fierce look.</p>

<p>“W’ot?” he howled. “W’ot’s dat yer say, kid?
W’y, I can break youse in two widout half-tryin’! Git
outer me way, ur I’ll biff yer, an’ ye’ll never know
w’ot happened!”</p>

<p>He started forward, but Dick immediately assumed
a position of readiness, retorting:</p>

<p>“Come on, you dirty duffer! Just walk right up
and biff me!”</p>

<p>The boys yelled:</p>

<p>“A fight! a fight! Smash him, Jim! Knock his
eye out!”</p>

<p>Jim expectorated on his hands.</p>

<p>“Dat’s jest w’ot I’ll do!” he vowed. “I’ll fit der
kid fer der hospital!”</p>

<p>Old Joe looked on without moving, but his hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
sought the haft of a hidden knife, while his lips murmured:</p>

<p>“I kill him, Dick! Cut him heart out!”</p>

<p>“No!” breathed the lad. “Don’t do it, Joe! He’ll
not hurt me much. Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>The young thug advanced on Dick, who immediately
moved aside to the left, beginning circling round him.</p>

<p>“Look at der kid!” cried the boys, in derision. “He
t’inks he’s a fighter! Jim’ll knock der eye outer him
in less’n t’ree seconds! T’ump him, Jim!”</p>

<p>The bully fancied Dick was frightened, and he tried
to close in quickly. Then the boy ducked and gave his
adversary a body-blow that made the big rough gasp.</p>

<p>“Hit him! hit him!” howled the boys, as they saw
their leader strike wildly past the head of the nimble
stranger.</p>

<p>“Methinks the gentle dub with the crooked eye got a
severe jolt in the bread-basket that time,” observed
Jack Ready.</p>

<p>The bully’s left eye had a cast in it.</p>

<p>“Drat ye!” gulped the fellow, as he tried to follow
Dick up. “Just keep still an’ I will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not say what he’d do; for again they closed,
and this time the youthful thug received a smash on
the jaw that made his head ring. He was astounded,
for he had not fancied the slender lad could strike such
a heavy blow. Not only was he surprised, but he was
doubly enraged and from his lips came a roar of rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Then the ruffian jumped at Dick in his fiercest manner,
his fists flying out and his arms thrashing the air.
From his lips rolled a torrent of profanity and foul
language.</p>

<p>With perfect self-command, which amused and
satisfied Frank, Dick avoided the rushes of the thug
and struck him heavily several times. In a very few
seconds these blows drew blood.</p>

<p>The boys who had followed the ruffian looked on
in amazement. They could hardly believe the evidence
of their eyes, for all of them had regarded
“Squinty” Jim as a fighter of great ability, and he
had lorded it over them in a high-handed manner.</p>

<p>“Squinty’s gettin’ licked!” one of them finally cried,
as if he could hardly believe it himself.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” snarled the big thug. But just then
Dick Merriwell’s fist caught him on the chin and he
was knocked down.</p>

<p>The fellow jumped up at once, but that blow had
dazed him, and Dick gave him no chance to recover.
The moment the fellow was fairly on his feet he received
another blow on the ear, and went down again.</p>

<p>“Somebody else hit me den!” he howled. “Dey’re
all jumpin’ on me, fellers! Come on an’ give it ter
’em!”</p>

<p>Then, as he scrambled to his feet, he urged the boys
to give him aid. A few of them seemed inclined to do
so, but one chap held them back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Let Squinty fight it out,” he said. “If he cannot
lick dat chap, he oughter git soaked.”</p>

<p>So the bully received no assistance, and Dick Merriwell
proceeded to polish him off in a most scientific
manner, without being once struck hard himself.</p>

<p>Still, with his arms folded, the old Indian looked on.
His face seemed expressionless as that of a graven
image, but the light in his beady eyes told of the
admiration in his heart.</p>

<p>Dick made short work of the bully, who soon lost
his spirit when he found the boy was more than his
match and that none of his friends would aid him.</p>

<p>At last, after being knocked down again, the fellow
looked up and whimpered:</p>

<p>“It ain’t fair! Yer didn’t give me no show!”</p>

<p>The crowd uttered a shout of derision.</p>

<p>“You’re licked!” cried many voices.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” said the fellow who had restrained
the boys from aiding the bully. “An’ if dat kid can
lick him, I can do it, too! You ain’t der boss of dis
gang no more, Squinty.”</p>

<p>“Get up!” panted Dick Merriwell, whose cheeks
were flushed and whose eyes gleamed. “Get up, and
I’ll give you some more of the same sort!”</p>

<p>“He don’t want it!” laughed many.</p>

<p>“You’re a dandy, young fellow!” cried a man.
“I’ve seen good men in my day, but I never saw one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
handle himself better than you can. You’ll make a
world-beater if you’ll train for the ring.”</p>

<p>Squinty Jim sat up.</p>

<p>“My brother’ll make somebody sorry fer dis!” he
declared. “He kin lick any old t’ing in dis town!”</p>

<p>“His brother is Bud McCann, the prize-fighter,”
said somebody. “He’s playing baseball this year.”</p>

<p>“Here comes a cop!” cried an urchin, and immediately
the boys began to scatter.</p>

<p>Squinty Jim got up, giving Dick a baleful look.</p>

<p>“Youse ain’t seen der last of me!” he grated, wiping
the blood from his bruised face with his sleeve. “I’ll
get even wid yer yit, see if I don’t!”</p>

<p>With this threat he slouched away.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">HONORED BY ALL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Frank Merriwell had not interfered. While he did
not believe in fighting, he knew Dick’s cause was just,
and he had wished to see if the boy could take care of
himself in such an affair. The result was decidedly
gratifying to Merry.</p>

<p>Old Joe had on many occasions watched Frank giving
Dick sparring-lessons, and the savage had regarded
the whole affair with supreme scorn and contempt.
More than once he had tersely expressed his
opinion in regard to it.</p>

<p>Now, however, there was such satisfaction expressed
on the old fellow’s usually stony face that the
look could not be mistaken. When the flushed and
triumphant boy turned about after the skulking away
of the bully, the redskin quickly put his arms about
the lad, saying:</p>

<p>“Heap good work! Steady Hand teach Injun
Heart mighty big white man trick with him hands.
Um can fight white man way heap good! Ugh!”</p>

<p>This was much for the old savage to say, and it
gave Dick a thrill of pride and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“He would have hurt you, Joe,” said the boy. “He
was ready to do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“No hurt me.”</p>

<p>“But he was ready to.”</p>

<p>“No hurt me,” insisted the Indian.</p>

<p>“Why not? You could not fight him with your
fists.”</p>

<p>“Knife heap ready. Him strike with fist, Joe
strike with knife. Cut him heart in two mighty
quick!”</p>

<p>“It is plain that you saved the fellow’s life, Dick,”
said Frank, his hand falling on the shoulder of his
brother; “yet I hardly think he would thank you if
he knew it. You showed that I have not wasted my
time and yours in giving you boxing-lessons. I am
rather proud of the way in which you put the young
thug out of commission.”</p>

<p>“Richard, my lively young gazelle, it was a sight
to gladden the heart and bring tears of joy to the
eye,” put in Jack Ready. “I wanted to slip into the
fracas, and gently t’ump somebody, but your greedy
brother insisted that you should have all the fun. He
wouldn’t let me mingle.”</p>

<p>The policeman now came into the midst of the
crowd, and demanded to know what was happening.
He regarded Old Joe with suspicion, and seemed
rather anxious to arrest somebody.</p>

<p>A citizen, however, explained the matter to him,
and he looked Dick Merriwell over curiously.</p>

<p>“That boy?” he asked, as if in doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the one,” answered the citizen.</p>

<p>“Did up Squinty Jim?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it, but it don’t seem possible. Squinty’s
one of the worst characters in this ward, and he’s always
fighting and whipping somebody.”</p>

<p>“He struck more than his match this time.”</p>

<p>“The boy ought to have a medal. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“They say he’s Frank Merriwell’s brother. I don’t
suppose you know who Frank Merriwell is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t I? Say, do you mean Frank Merriwell,
the great athlete of Yale College?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There he is standing beside the boy now.”</p>

<p>“What? Is that the real Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“It is. He’s stopping at the Continental.”</p>

<p>The officer strode up to Merry.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon,” he said, with an air of politeness.
“Is what I’ve just heard true?”</p>

<p>Merry smiled, saying:</p>

<p>“I am sure I can’t say, sir, for I don’t know what
you have just heard.”</p>

<p>“A man just told me that you are the genuine
Frank Merriwell of Yale.”</p>

<p>“I must confess that the gentleman told you the
truth. I am Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“And this chap who just did up Squinty Jim is
your brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” said the policeman, “I want to
shake hands with you. I have a boy who owes his
life to you.”</p>

<p>The earnestness of the officer showed he was perfectly
sincere, and Merry readily shook hands.</p>

<p>“Owes his life to me?” said Frank, in some surprise.
“How is that? What have I done for your
boy?”</p>

<p>“Saved his life, and yet you have never seen him
to know him. He has seen you, though. He has
seen you play football and baseball. He has read
much about you in the newspapers. He was not a
strong boy, and he early fell into habits of dissipation.
He drank and traveled with a gang. He
smoked forty and fifty cigarettes a day. He was
fast becoming a total wreck when he first saw you
play football here against U. of P.</p>

<p>“He talked about your playing for days. Then he
began to find out everything he could about you.
Somehow, he learned that you were not strong at one
time, and he also learned that you never smoke, drink,
or carouse. Something led him to resolve to be as
much like you as possible. He had will-power, sir,
and he at once quit his old companions, stopped drinking,
and gave up smoking. The last thing was the
hardest to do. It was a hard fight for him, but he
conquered. Everybody had told me he would go into
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'quick  mption'">quick consumption</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“That was almost two years ago. To-day my boy
is healthy and strong and manly. He belongs to a
Y. M. C. A. gym, where he goes regularly every
night, and they say he is fast becoming an athlete.
More than that, he is working to save money, and is
attending a school to fit himself for college. Mr.
Merriwell, I have longed to meet you, and I’ve often
thought of writing to you and telling you the good
you had done my boy. I cannot repay you, sir, but
I take off my hat to you as the model young American,
and one every true American should be proud
of!”</p>

<p>Then, before the Continental Hotel in the city of
Philadelphia, was seen the remarkable spectacle of a
policeman uncovering his head to a civilian, a youth
whom he had not known by sight twenty minutes
before.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell had heard the words of the officer,
and he thrilled from his feet to his head, whispering
to himself:</p>

<p>“It is my brother! Everybody honors him! Officers
take off their hats to him! All say he is a model
American youth. Ah! can I ever become thus famous
and loved! I do not believe it is possible!”</p>

<p>Frank had been touched himself, and he now assured
the officer that he desired to meet his son, which
gave the man no small satisfaction, as he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll bring Bob round. It is one great desire of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
life to shake hands with you, and he’ll be jealous when
he hears I’ve got ahead of him.”</p>

<p>A time was set when Frank would meet the officer’s
son, that evening, and then the policeman saluted
and turned away.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe the things me heavenly blue eyes
have seen, nor those me shell-like ears have heard!”
came from Jack Ready. “A cop hath lifted his tile
to thee, O most noble snoozer! and his language was
the language of respect, yet thou art not an alderman,
nor yet a political boss. And this in Philadelphia!
Ye gods! the heavens will fall next!”</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">A HOT OPENING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a remarkable crowd that turned out to witness
the game between Merriwell’s ball-team and the
Philadelphia Athletics. It was made up mainly of
young people. A good part of the young men were
college fellows who knew Merriwell by reputation, or
had met him.</p>

<p>As the Athletics had shown themselves to be one
of the fastest among the big league teams, it was
generally admitted that Merriwell’s nine would have
a hard show to win. Nevertheless, the youthful element
of the gathering was strongly in sympathy with
Frank.</p>

<p>But the Athletics had plenty of fans on hand to
root for them, and odds of five to one were offered
that the home team would win.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame to see so much good money go begging!”
sighed Jack Ready; “but Merry has given notice
that we are to make no bets. The trouble with
him is that he has too much conscience to play baseball.
Why, he wouldn’t even buy an umpire if he
knew the other side was stealing a game! He needs
a pair of wings and a harp!”</p>

<p>The Athletics appeared on the field first and got in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
some batting-practise. They were not at all inclined
to work, but Nick Robinson was a man who permitted
no soldiering, and every man had to stand up
and swing the club a certain number of times.</p>

<p>It was a team of hitters, and they agreed among
themselves to put Merriwell out of the box in less
than three innings. They fancied it would be no trick
at all.</p>

<p>When Merriwell’s nine appeared they were received
with a shout of applause from the college men and
waving of handkerchiefs in the hands of the young
ladies assembled. Frank was pointed out to hundreds
of girls who were eager to see him, and all
declared him “just perfectly splendid!”</p>

<p>But the appearance of Dick Merriwell in uniform
was the surprise of the day at the start.</p>

<p>“Look at that boy!” exclaimed more than one. “It
can’t be he is going to play!”</p>

<p>But when Merry’s team trotted out onto the field
to practise, Dick went to short. It was not long before
it became almost generally known that the boy
was Frank’s brother, which caused the spectators to
watch him with great interest.</p>

<p>It happened that the very first ball batted to Dick
went through him, and that gave the spectators the
impression that he could not fill his position.</p>

<p>“Merriwell is foolish to put him in there,” said
more than one. “He has another man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>The tenth man was Carker, who was to sit on the
bench.</p>

<p>In practise Frank’s team did not show up quite as
well as the professionals, though Merry tried to impart
some of his restless energy to them and fill them
with life and spirit.</p>

<p>Rattleton was somewhat oppressed by the magnitude
of the task before them, which Frank had discovered.
Merry knew it would be a bad thing if the others got
to feeling that they were outclassed.</p>

<p>When they came in from practise the positions of
both teams had been given to the scorers thus:</p>

</table>

<p>The home team chose to take the field first, and
Ready was sent to the bat.</p>

<p>As they sat on the bench Dick Merriwell observed
a fellow on the bench of the home players, and a
second look showed the boy that it was his antagonist
of the day before, Squinty Jim. He was talking to a
stocky-looking chap in the uniform of the Athletics,
the latter seeming to be a spare man on the team,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
and Dick noticed that they were looking across toward
the bench of the visitors.</p>

<p>At once the boy was struck by the belief that they
were talking about him. He had heard that the
young bully had a brother who played with the Athletics,
but the name of McCann was not on the batting-order.</p>

<p>The umpire’s command to play ball drew the lad’s
attention from the pair on the opposite bench, and he
fell to watching Ready.</p>

<p>Jack was a confident chap, and a good fellow to
head the batting-order, although not a hard hitter.
His eye was good, and he seldom went after bad ones,
which made it possible for him to get first on balls
more than any other man on the team.</p>

<p>To-day, however, Jack was soon to find that he
could not work Nesbitt for a pass to first. The Athletic
pitcher was satisfied that the youthful players
against him would be dazed by his speed, and so he
began by “burning ’em over.”</p>

<p>Two strikes were called on Jack in short order, and
he had not swung for either of them.</p>

<p>Frank signed for Jack to hit it out.</p>

<p>Nesbitt was laughing, and several of the players
behind him assured him that the “kids” could not see
the ball.</p>

<p>The third ball came with fearful speed.</p>

<p>Ready simply held up his bat, gripping it firmly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
and let the ball hit it. The result was surprising, for
a clean single was secured in this manner.</p>

<p>Then Frank went down to the coaching-line by first
and opened up.</p>

<p>This hit won for Ready a round of applause, while
Nesbitt looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind that, Nes!” cried the men behind him.
“It was an accident.”</p>

<p>Carson advanced to the plate, taking a look toward
Frank. Merry signaled for Berlin to bunt toward third.</p>

<p>Nesbitt gathered himself, and sent the next ball
over with the same wonderful speed. In the most
scientific manner possible, Carson bunted, and the ball
rolled toward third.</p>

<p>Ready had started “with the pitch,” and therefore
he was too far on his way to be stopped.</p>

<p>Flobert ran in and got the ball, saw he could not
stop Ready, and threw to first.</p>

<p>With the speed of a frightened jack-rabbit, Carson
raced down to first, and he reached the bag ahead of
the ball.</p>

<p>It was a close decision, and the captain of the home
team raised a kick when the umpire declared it safe;
but the umpire quickly quieted the protest, ordering
the next batter up.</p>

<p>Hodge was the man, and he longed to hit the ball
hard, believing he could drive in at least one score.
Merry, however, signed for Bart to bunt toward first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>Frank’s system of signals was complete, and both
base-runners knew just what was to happen if Hodge
could meet the ball right.</p>

<p>Holding his bat loosely, Bart succeeded in bunting
the very first ball, sending it rolling along just inside
the chalk-line that led from the home plate to first
bag.</p>

<p>Hodge sped toward first, while Ready raced up to
third and Carson went down to second.</p>

<p>Bowers sprang after the ball, but it rolled along
beyond his reach in a most provoking manner, and
he secured it just too late to throw Bart out.</p>

<p>This clever opening by Frank’s team set the spectators
on edge and astounded the home team.</p>

<p>Nesbitt had fancied the youngsters could not get
five safe hits off him, yet three had been made by
the first three batters to face him, although two of
them were bunts.</p>

<p>At this point Frank fancied he had made a mistake
in placing Browning fourth on the list, for Bruce
could not sacrifice very well, and a sacrifice hit would
make it easy to bring in a run.</p>

<p>Bruce had seen the others bunting, and that led
him to believe Nesbitt easy to hit. He picked out his
own heavy bat and loafed up to the plate.</p>

<p>Rattleton was chattering away near third, and
every one was on edge for what was to follow.</p>

<p>The first ball was high, and Bruce let it pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“One ball,” was the decision.</p>

<p>The next was wide.</p>

<p>“Two balls.”</p>

<p>Then came a sharp drop, which fooled the big fellow,
who fancied it a straight one.</p>

<p>Bruce fanned.</p>

<p>“One strike!”</p>

<p>Nesbitt followed with a rise, and Browning struck
under it.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>“Got him in a hole, Nes!” was the cry.</p>

<p>Nesbitt ventured to waste a ball, but Browning did
not bite at it. The next one would have to be over,
or a run might be forced in.</p>

<p>Frank had decided that Nesbitt was a heady pitcher
in a tight place, and he began to fear that Browning
would not prove equal to the emergency.</p>

<p>Ready was taking a long lead off third at every pitch,
resolved to go in the instant he found an opportunity.</p>

<p>Nesbitt held the ball as long as permissible, made
sure every man was in the proper place, looked hard
at Browning, then sent in one with a movement that
seemed to indicate it would be very speedy.</p>

<p>Right there in that moment the professional twirler
showed his brains and nerve, for the ball was a very
slow one, sailing up to the plate like a wounded duck.</p>

<p>Browning was fooled completely, for he slashed at it
far too soon, failing to hit it at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>“You’re out!” declared the umpire, as the catcher
held the ball.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the admirers of the home
team. Browning looked disgusted as he flung aside
his bat and retired to the bench.</p>

<p>“I’m a chump!” he growled. “Why, a baby could
have knocked that out of the lot!”</p>

<p>“Let him gug-gug-gug-give me one of them darn
things!” muttered Gamp, as he picked out a bat. “Bet
a Hubbard squash I’ll hit it!”</p>

<p>But Nesbitt started with a high one that pulled
Gamp easily, and a strike was called.</p>

<p>More than ever Merry feared that the clever work
at the start would be wasted through the failure of
the following batters to connect with the sphere.</p>

<p>Another high one followed, but Joe shook his head,
though he came near swinging.</p>

<p>“No, ye dud-dud-don’t!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Nesbitt grinned. Then came a drop, and a second
strike was called on Joe, who failed to swing at the
ball.</p>

<p>Again Nesbitt grinned.</p>

<p>Gamp was anxious now, and his anxiety led him
to go after an out drop, which he could not touch.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>Another shout went up, and the home players
laughed loudly.</p>

<p>Gamp’s face was red as a beet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“I oughter go sus-sus-sus-soak my head!” he stuttered,
as he retired to the bench.</p>

<p>Swiftwing was the next hitter. He stalked out
with his bat, and somebody raised a whoop.</p>

<p>“Fan the chief, Nes!” cried somebody from the
bleachers.</p>

<p>The pitcher showed his teeth again, and then he
put over a high one, to start with.</p>

<p>Swiftwing half-swung at the ball, but held his bat
in time, so that the umpire called it a ball. An in
shoot followed, and the young Indian was compelled
to spring back from the plate.</p>

<p>Then came a drop, and Swiftwing lifted a high
foul back of first base, which was easily captured by
Hayward.</p>

<p>The thing Merry had feared had happened. For
all of the clever work at the start, not a score had
been made, and Nesbitt had shown himself a heady
pitcher in a tight place.</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” said Merry, but Swiftwing grimly
shook his head as he trotted out onto the field.</p>

<p>Hodge was sore, and he betrayed it.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of bunting?” he exclaimed. “If
I had hit the ball out, we’d made one run, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“If one of the batters behind you had hit the ball
out, the chances are that more than one run would
have come in,” said Merry.</p>

<p>“But they didn’t hit it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“You might not have hit it.”</p>

<p>But Bart felt that he might, and he continued to
look black and dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Hodge was once more in good form for catching,
and Merry felt that his wrist would stand to use the
double-shoot when the emergency demanded.</p>

<p>Hayward seized a bat and rushed up to the plate,
in order not to give Frank a chance to limber up by
throwing a few over to first. Frank looked at the
fellow a moment, simply observing:</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my friend.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it is,” sneered Hayward. “Put ’em over,
and I’ll bust the stitches in the old thing.”</p>

<p>The action of the batter had placed Merry on his
mettle, and he gave the fellow a sharp in shoot at the
start.</p>

<p>Hayward fancied the ball was straight over, and
he swung hard. It was a foul. As they were playing
the game under old rules, this did not count
against the batter.</p>

<p>“Try another,” he urged.</p>

<p>Frank seemed to do so, but the ball dropped sharply
just before reaching the batter, and Hayward did not
touch it.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty clever!” said the batter. “Try another,
young fellow.”</p>

<p>Merry now assumed a position that told Hodge he
would resort to the double-shoot. He started the ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
straight at Hayward, who jumped back, only to see
it give a queer double twist and cut a corner of the
plate. The umpire, however, fancied his eyes had
deceived him, and called a ball.</p>

<p>Again Merry used the double-shoot, but this time
he reversed the curves, and Hayward did not lift
his bat from his shoulder. He was amazed and disgusted
when the umpire called a strike.</p>

<p>Following this, Merry sent in a sharp rise that
nearly dragged the batter off his feet in an endeavor
to chase it. It was not even a foul tip, and Bart
smothered the ball in his big mitt.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to need to limber up, dear sir,”
chirped Jack Ready. “Oh, dear, dear! what queer
quirks he can put into the ball! Isn’t it really and
truly remarkable!”</p>

<p>“You’re a mark, Hay!” laughed McGlinkey, as he
picked up the bat the first hitter had tossed aside.
“Before I’d let him strike me out! Why, I’m going
to knock the ball a mile!”</p>

<p>He did not succeed in coming anywhere near keeping
his word, for Merry deceived him on the very
first one pitched over. It was an in shoot, and the
ball struck the handle of the bat close to McGlinkey’s
knuckles. Up into the air went the sphere, and Merry
easily captured it as it came down.</p>

<p>“La! la!” came from Jack Ready. “Isn’t it aw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>fully
easy! But it isn’t fair not to give anybody else
a show. The rest of us want something to do, just
to keep warm.”</p>

<p>Now Merriwell’s admirers broke loose in a bunch,
and the way they shouted for him was enough to
warm the heart of his brother.</p>

<p>“Everybody seems to know Frank,” thought Dick.
“And they all think him a wonder. Hear them cheer
for him!”</p>

<p>Hodge was feeling better, and the frown was disappearing
from his face, for he saw that Merry was in
the best possible trim, which meant that there would
be little heavy hitting done by the professionals in
that game.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, Merry,” he said. “They can’t touch
you to-day, old man.”</p>

<p>Waldron was one of the surest batters on the home
team. He picked up his favorite slugger, and advanced
to the plate with it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Strike this man out, Merriwell,” cried somebody
on the bleachers. “I’ll bet a hundred dollars you
can’t do it!”</p>

<p>This was enough to indicate just how Waldron was
regarded as a batter, and it made Merry decidedly
cautious. He began with a sharp drop, which Waldron
fouled.</p>

<p>“That won’t do!” Merriwell mentally exclaimed.
“He can hit drops.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>A rise followed, but it was higher than the batter’s
shoulders when it passed over the plate, and Waldron
let it pass.</p>

<p>“One ball,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Bart called for the double-shoot. Merry had not
wished to use it on the fellow so soon, but he nodded
and sent it in.</p>

<p>Waldron saw the ball start for him and begin to
curve quickly, as if going over the plate. Regarding
it as an ordinary out, the batter swung. To his
amazement, the ball reversed and shot in, striking him
glancingly on the wrist.</p>

<p>Waldron dropped the bat and started for first, but
the umpire promptly sent him back.</p>

<p>“I was hit!” cried the fellow. “Can’t I take my
base on that?”</p>

<p>“Not when you strike at the ball,” was the answer.
“Stand up there and hit.”</p>

<p>So Waldron was forced to do so, and he proceeded
to fan out, for all that he was regarded as such a
remarkable batter.</p>

<p>The first inning was over, and neither side had
scored. The visitors had filled the bags, but not one
of the home team had reached first in safety.</p>

<p>This opening seemed to indicate that the game
would be a hot one.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">A DASTARDLY TRICK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The crowd roared its approval, for Frank Merriwell
had shown himself quite in the same class as
Nesbitt, the professional. Indeed, the work of Merry
in the box had aroused Nesbitt’s jealousy, and he resolved
to show them that he was quite as good as the
former great Yale pitcher.</p>

<p>“I object to this, Merriwell!” cried Ready, as he
trotted in from third. “If you don’t give me a chance
to show what I can do in this game, I’ll quit your
old team just as soon as you don’t want me any more.
I won’t play with this team a minute after it disbands,
so there, now!”</p>

<p>“In your old form, Merry,” said Hodge. “Why,
you can make the ball cut any kind of quirks to-day.
The double is right at your command.”</p>

<p>Bart’s anger had passed, and his face wore a pleasant
look that was almost a smile.</p>

<p>“The same old dim-jandy!” spluttered Harry Rattleton,
who had trotted in at Merry’s side. “Why,
you can spock the knots&mdash;I mean you can knock the
spots off any professional in the country!”</p>

<p>“Tell me about that when I’ve grown too old to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
pitch any more,” smiled Merry. “I’ll enjoy hearing
about it then.”</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell flew past them toward the bench,
turning cart-wheels as he went. He wound up with
a handspring and a burst of wild laughter that attracted
general attention.</p>

<p>On the bench of the home players Squinty Jim was
saying to the fellow in the uniform of the Athletic
players:</p>

<p>“Dat kid is der one, Bud, an’ I wants ye ter break
his ribs der fust punch. Dat’ll git me even wid
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on an’ lick him yerself!” returned the other
fellow. “I’d be ’shamed ter hit a babby like dat.”</p>

<p>“Say, he ain’t no babby, Bud; he’s a holy terror.”</p>

<p>“Yer ain’t goin’ ter tell me ag’in dat he done yer
widout help?”</p>

<p>“Well, he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If ye does, Jim, ye ain’t no broder of mine. Ye
oughter lick dat boy wid one hand tied behind yer
an’ yer eyes shut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I might ’a’ done it,” said the young ruffian,
“but all his friends was wid him.”</p>

<p>“Thought you said none of ’em touched yer?”</p>

<p>“Well, none of ’em did&mdash;’cept his broder.”</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“Wot did he do?” demanded the fellow in uniform
sharply. “If he done anyt’ing to my broder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Squinty Jim saw his chance, and he glibly lied:</p>

<p>“He tripped me up once, dat’s all.”</p>

<p>“Is dat all?” exclaimed the other, his bulldog face
getting purple.</p>

<p>“Jest w’en I had der little cuss, too,” said Squinty.</p>

<p>“W’y didn’t yer tell me dat at fust?” harshly demanded
the other.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s der kid I’m der sorest over. He’s der
one I wanted ter see done up.”</p>

<p>“It’s der odder mug I’m der sorest over. Tripped
yer, did he? Well, mebbe he’ll find dere are odders
can do some trippin’.”</p>

<p>The fellow in uniform was Bud McCann, brother
to Jim McCann, who was familiarly known as Squinty
Jim. Bud had started out as a pugilist, but had
drifted into baseball, having proved himself a handy
utility man for either the infield or outfield. His old
fighting-spirit was aroused by the falsehood told him
by Jim, which he readily swallowed, as he could not
fancy it possible that Squinty had been whipped fairly
without assistance by Dick Merriwell.</p>

<p>Squinty was not particularly anxious to get at
Frank, but he did desire vengeance on Dick. He saw,
however, that the only way to get Bud thoroughly
aroused was to tell him a falsehood concerning the
encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“Wot’ll yer do, Bud?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just wait, an’ mebbe you’ll see,” was the answer.
“I kinder feel like gittin’ at dat fresh college guy,
anyhow. Dese college chaps make me sick! Dey
t’ink dey must be somebody just because dey has
been ter college. Now, wot good does goin’ ter college
do anybody? All dis guff ’bout an edercation
gives me a pain! Wot’s der use of knowin’ a lot of
truck about Latin or Greek? Give me der <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'English langguage'">English
language</ins>, an’ jest as long as I knows how ter handle
dat as well as I does I won’t take a back seat fer no
college bloke.”</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Squinty. “He’s the first batter
this time.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll bet my shirt Nesbitt fans him.”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell had picked out his favorite bat
and advanced to the plate. Nesbitt smiled when he
saw Merry come up, thinking Frank would be easy,
as, in most cases, pitchers are not good hitters.</p>

<p>The catcher had adjusted his mask and body-protector,
and he gave the pitcher a sign. The latter
nodded, then sent in a speedy in shoot that caused
Merry to dodge.</p>

<p>“One ball,” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Frank stood up to the plate again.</p>

<p>“Put him back, Mr. Umpire,” requested Nesbitt.
“He’s too close.”</p>

<p>But Merry was in his box, and the umpire declined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
to move him. Again Nesbitt used the in shoot, but
this time he caused Frank to get still farther back.</p>

<p>“Two balls.”</p>

<p>“Now comes an out,” decided Merry, and he was
right, for the pitcher tried to pull him on the next one.</p>

<p>When Frank refused to fan, Nesbitt found another
ball had been called on him.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t dare let you hit it, Merry!” cried Jack
Ready.</p>

<p>“Don’t I?” muttered the pitcher. “See if he’ll try
this one.”</p>

<p>He sent over a pretty one, but Frank was playing
the game, and he did not swing at it.</p>

<p>“One strike!” exclaimed the umpire.</p>

<p>The pitcher followed with another of the same kind.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>Then Nesbitt tried just what Frank fancied he
would. He started the ball high, but gave it a drop,
so it fell as it was about to pass Frank.</p>

<p>But it never passed. Merry hit it fair and lined it
out.</p>

<p>It was a clean single, but Frank took a desperate
chance of making second. The fielder saw what
Frank was trying to do, and made a poor throw in his
haste to catch Merry. Frank slid and went under
the hand of the baseman, who tried to reach him with
the ball.</p>

<p>“Safe!” said the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“Wasn’t it pretty?” cried Jack Ready, as he pranced
down to third. “Why, he’s the only fellow on the
ground who could make a two-bagger out of that dink
hit! Come on, Merry, old bird! get your wings into
gear and cover space!”</p>

<p>Nesbitt was purple with rage. The great crowd
was shouting its approval of Merriwell’s work, and
the excitement seemed intense.</p>

<p>Rattleton was nervous, for he had not yet recovered
from his original conviction that the professionals outclassed
Frank’s team, and he felt himself shivering a
little when he advanced to the plate to strike.</p>

<p>Nesbitt resorted to his speediest ball, sending it
over high.</p>

<p>Frank took lots of ground on the pitch, and Bowers
failed to hold the ball, which gave Merry a chance
to try for third.</p>

<p>Never in his life had Frank made better speed than
he did on that effort to steal, knowing that the ball
had not gone far from the reach of the catcher.</p>

<p>Bowers got the ball quickly, and lined it down to
third. Again Merry slid, and again he went under
the hand that reached for him with the ball in its
grasp.</p>

<p>“Safe!” came once more from the umpire.</p>

<p>Now the roar of applause took on a new note,
shrill and joyous, telling that hundreds of girls were
shrieking with delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“Why, he’ll steal home in a minute!” cried Ready,
as the uproar subsided. “Couldn’t stop him from
scoring with a shotgun! It’s a pleasant little way he
has of winning games. La! la! Isn’t he a peach,
girls?”</p>

<p>“He’s all right!” cried scores of voices. “Hurrah
for Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Rattleton looked toward Merry, who gave him the
sign to sacrifice. Then Harry picked out an opening
between second base and first, and resolved to put the
ball through it if possible.</p>

<p>It was not an easy thing, however, to place a hit
with Nesbitt in the box, and Rattleton simply succeeded
in popping up <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a litle fly'">a little fly</ins> that was gathered in
by Waldron.</p>

<p>Frank leaped off third, as if contemplating an attempt
to score after the ball was caught, but Waldron
was too good to be lured into a bad throw, and
Merry was forced to retreat.</p>

<p>Now it was Dick’s turn to hit.</p>

<p>“Oh, what fruit!” cried Joiler. “He couldn’t hit
it out of the diamond, anyhow. Put the ball right
over, Nes.”</p>

<p>Nesbitt decided to do so, and the first one fairly
whistled.</p>

<p>Frank, however, had given the boy a sign for a
bunt, and Dick simply held up his bat, letting it be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
loose in his hands and drawing it back the least bit as
the ball struck it.</p>

<p>The result was a beautiful bunt toward first.</p>

<p>Frank was coming down the line when the bunt
was made, and he must have scored had not something
happened.</p>

<p>From somewhere a bat came flying out and fell between
Merry’s feet, so that he was tripped and flung
headlong.</p>

<p>A shout of astonishment and indignation rose from
the witnesses of this dastardly trick.</p>

<p>Men and women rose to their feet and uttered their
angry indignation in that shout.</p>

<p>Frank had been thrown heavily, and he seemed
stunned for a moment. Before he could recover, the
ball was thrown across to Flobert, who tagged him.</p>

<p>Then Merry got up, and his eyes sought and found
the fellow who had thrown the bat. It was Bud McCann,
and Merry went after the fellow in short order.</p>

<p>McCann, fancying himself a fighter of ability, did
not try to get away.</p>

<p>“You cur!” grated Frank, as he sprang at McCann
and grasped him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Git out!” returned the fellow, making a pass at
Merry’s face.</p>

<p>Afterward Bud was sorry he tried to strike Frank
then, for, an instant later, a hard fist smote him
between the eyes, knocking him down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>McCann jumped up quickly and went for Frank
before any one could interfere. Merry simply parried
the fellow’s second blow and gave him such a terrible
thump that McCann was hurled to the ground fifteen
feet away.</p>

<p>Then the players closed in to separate them, but
there was no need of bothering, for the prize-fighting
ball-player had been finished off in short order, and
it was necessary to pour water over him before he
could tell his own name.</p>

<p>Squinty Jim was dazed with astonishment, for he
had fancied that his brother would make short work
of Frank Merriwell. When it was all over, Squinty
fancied it must be a dream.</p>

<p>Then came a brief argument over the proper thing
to do, and the umpire decided to send Frank back
to third, for all that Merry insisted that the proper
decision was to give him a run. However, McCann
swore he didn’t throw the bat, and there were several
others who asserted that the trick was done by an
outsider. Of course, it was a lie, but on the strength
of it Frank was returned to third.</p>

<p>Merry had not said a word, but his fall had given
his wrist a bad wrench, and he was worried. Not
many weeks before he had sprained that same wrist
severely, which prevented him from pitching in several
games, and now he was afraid it had been hurt again.</p>

<p>Dick had reached first, and only one man was out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Ready came to the bat. Frank signed for him to
fan at the first one, giving Dick a chance to go down
to second.</p>

<p>That signal was obeyed, and the boy scooted for
second, while a strike was called on Jack.</p>

<p>The catcher did not make a bluff at throwing Dick
out.</p>

<p>Once more it seemed that Merriwell’s team would
be sure to get in a run.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me!” said Ready cheerfully. “I’ll
bump the ball a mile or two.”</p>

<p>“Bump that!” cried the catcher, as Nesbitt sent in
another speedy one.</p>

<p>Jack went after it hard, but the curve fooled him,
and he did not connect.</p>

<p>“Try another,” he urged.</p>

<p>Nesbitt gave him an out drop, and he stopped his
bat in time to avoid the penalty.</p>

<p>Then came a drop that got down too quick for
Ready, and two strikes were called.</p>

<p>“It’s the same thing over again, Nes,” came from
Waldron. “They can never score.”</p>

<p>Ready was disgusted and desperate. He realized
that he could not do much trying to hit the ball hard,
and so he resolved on an attempt to sacrifice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Jack, he met the ball a trifle
too hard, and it went straight into the hands of Waldron,
who picked it up clean and whirled as if to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
throw it to the plate or to third. This forced Frank
back to third, and then Waldron quickly threw Ready
out at first.</p>

<p>Two men were gone, and now it did seem that the
visitors had little show of making a run.</p>

<p>“T’rowin’ dat bat between Merriwell’s feet’s wot
kept ’em from scorin’, Bud,” said Squinty, who was
again on the bench at the side of his brother.</p>

<p>“T’rowin’ dat bat at him is wot gave me dis eye!”
growled Bud. “I didn’t s’pose dat gilly could hit
like dat, else I’d been ready fer him.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s der way wid me,” said Jim. “I didn’t have
no idea his kid broder could fight like he can.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll settle wid Merriwell yit!” vowed Bud.
“Next time I’ll soak him hard!”</p>

<p>“An’ I’m goin’ ter git a crack at der kid,” asserted
Squinty. “I’ll knock his everlastin’ block off!”</p>

<p>Carson looked determined enough as he came up to
hit. He felt the responsibility of the occasion and
wondered if he could meet it. Something told him
that the game was to be one in which a single lost
opportunity might stand for defeat.</p>

<p>Carson let two balls pass, one of which was called
a strike. Then he met one and sent it out on a line.
The pitcher tried to dodge, turning his back so that
the ball struck him between the shoulders and bounded
off in a direct line to the short-stop, who gathered it in
and whistled it over to first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>Berlin was out, and again, for all of Frank’s energy
and skill in base-running, not a score had come in.</p>

<p>Frank covertly felt of his wrist as he walked into
the box, finding it sore and lame. Bowers hastened
to get out in batting position, so that Frank would
not have a chance to limber up.</p>

<p>“Use him the way you did Hayward, Merry,” cried
Hodge, giving the sign for the double-shoot at the
start.</p>

<p>Merry shook his head, fearing to try it with his
wrist feeling as it did.</p>

<p>Bart called for an out, and Merry sent one in.
Bowers let it pass without stirring.</p>

<p>The next one was a high in shoot, and the batter
let that go by.</p>

<p>“Put ’em over,” he said.</p>

<p>Frank resorted to a high one, and Bowers got
against it savagely, driving out a single. He was
not satisfied to stop on first, however, but tried to
follow Merry’s example in stretching the hit into a
two-bagger.</p>

<p>Swiftwing got the ball and lined it to second.
Bowers slid at Rattleton with his spikes, having found
Harry was waiting for him with the ball. The spikes
cut Rattleton’s leg and tore his trousers, but he placed
the ball onto the runner, putting him out. At the
same time he was hurled down on Bowers, into whose
stomach he drove his knee with great violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>Bowers lay still on the ground after the umpire
declared him out, and he was found to be unconscious.</p>

<p>“It’s his own fault!” declared scores on the bleachers
and in the grand stand. “He tried to spike Merriwell’s
second-baseman. He got just what he deserved.”</p>

<p>After a time Bowers revived, and was assisted from
the ground, but he was hurt so badly that it was
necessary to pull him out of the game.</p>

<p>Bud McCann was given his place, for McCann
could catch as well as he could do anything else.</p>

<p>Webster, the next hitter, picked out a good one,
and drove it almost directly over the third base, but
Ready made a lucky jab at it, stopped it, got it up,
and threw the fellow out at first.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” cried Jack, in apparent satisfaction.
“Now we are getting something to do! I thought
Merry would not be greedy and keep all the fun to
himself.”</p>

<p>Joiler scowled blackly as he came up to hit. The
manner in which the game was running did not suit
him at all.</p>

<p>Merry started with a high one, but Joiler would
not go after it. Then followed a quick out drop, but
not even that one pulled the batter.</p>

<p>“Cut the plate, old boy!” cried Carson.</p>

<p>“Pup-pup-pup-put it right over!” came from Gamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“Hake nim mit it&mdash;I mean make him hit it!” spluttered
Rattleton.</p>

<p>“Nobody walks,” rumbled Browning.</p>

<p>“Give us a little exercise, Frankie,” urged Ready.</p>

<p>“We’re longing for it,” piped up Dick.</p>

<p>Then Frank put it right over, and Joiler hit it a
terrible rap, that sounded like the report of a small
cannon.</p>

<p>“Get after that for exercise!” he cried, as he scooted
for first.</p>

<p>“Home run!” howled the crowd, again rising in a
body and staring after the ball.</p>

<p>The sphere was sailing toward deep center, and it
seemed that it must pass high over the head of Gamp,
who had started on a run the moment the hit came.</p>

<p>“He can’t touch it!” was the cry.</p>

<p>Indeed, it looked impossible for the long-legged
youth to get anywhere near the ball, but he was covering
ground at great speed, and he did not slacken a
bit.</p>

<p>It required good judgment in such a case, and
Gamp displayed it, for he ran like a deer until he
fancied the ball must be coming down, when he turned
his head and saw it sailing earthward above him.</p>

<p>Just as the ball was falling Joe made a great leap
into the air and clutched it. Down he went, turning
completely over, but he came up immediately, holding
the ball in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>The decision of the umpire could not be heard, for
the uproar that came from the spectators was the
greatest yet heard on the ground that day.</p>

<p>Never had a fielder in Philadelphia made such an
astonishing catch, and the crowd went wild with admiration.</p>

<p>Joiler ran all the way round the bases, and then
would not believe it when he was told the ball had
been caught and he was out. He swore Gamp must
have had another ball, for he felt certain the right
ball had passed over Joe’s head at least twenty feet.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE FIRST RUN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“What’s the matter, Merry?” asked Bart anxiously,
as Frank came in to the bench. “You did not use the
double-shoot once in that inning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why not give the boys something to do?” said
Frank. “They are shouting for it.”</p>

<p>He did not think it advisable to let Bart know his
wrist had been injured. Still, knowing Merry as he
did, Hodge seemed to feel that something was wrong,
and this thought was in his mind when he picked out
a bat and stepped up to the plate.</p>

<p>Two innings had passed without a score, and now
Bart was resolved to do something to put the Merries
into the game.</p>

<p>Nesbitt realized at last that he was up against something
more than a lot of “easy marks,” and he decided
that the snap was not so great as he had fancied at the
outset.</p>

<p>Bart was cool, although he appeared anxious, and
Nesbitt’s caution led him into the mistake of giving
the batter a pass to first. Hodge flung aside his bat
and trotted down, while Merry immediately took a position
on the coaching-line.</p>

<p>Crouching there, Frank gave the signal to “hit and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
run,” knowing Browning would find it difficult to bunt
or sacrifice.</p>

<p>The first one was good enough, and Bruce met it.
Already Hodge was scooting for second.</p>

<p>The ball went straight at Joiler, who fell over himself
in his anxiety to pick it up quick enough for a
double play. The ball rolled between the feet of the
short-stop and avoided his hand a moment. When he
got it he made a snap throw to Waldron on second,
and, without hesitation, Hodge slid feet first for the
bag.</p>

<p>Waldron came down on Hodge with the ball, but he
went over onto his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Out!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Waldron lay on the ground groaning when Bart
got up. It was found that he had injured his shoulder,
and time was called. A doctor soon announced that
the shoulder was displaced, and it was necessary to
set it at once. Waldron could play no more in that
game.</p>

<p>Robinson had not fancied more than one substitute
would be needed, yet now there was a call for another.</p>

<p>“Give me time enough, and I’ll have another man,”
he said, as he hurried away to the dressing-room beneath
the grand stand.</p>

<p>In a very short space of time he reappeared in uniform.</p>

<p>Not many years before this Nick Robinson had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
reckoned a fast infielder. He had kept in practise by
often getting onto the field with his men, and now he
welcomed the opportunity to get into a game of this
sort.</p>

<p>Robinson was given a hand as he trotted out onto
the diamond, which he acknowledged by touching his
cap.</p>

<p>Hodge was out, Browning was on first, and Gamp
was the hitter.</p>

<p>During the wait Frank had sought to impart some
of his restless energy to Bruce, drilling into the big
fellow the importance of playing a lively game and
working hard for scores. Merry knew Bruce could
run when he let himself out, but Browning seemed too
lazy to make the circle of the bases in less than twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>Gamp understood that the big fellow would attempt
to steal, and he regarded the matter as a very foolish
piece of business on Merriwell’s part.</p>

<p>“Frank ought to know Bruce cuc-cuc-cuc-can’t run
faster than a snail,” thought Joe.</p>

<p>However, he obeyed the sign, which was for him
to slash at the first ball pitched. This he did most
successfully, missing it easily, and falling backward
to bother the catcher.</p>

<p>Gamp’s floundering about bothered McCann just
long enough to make it impossible to catch Browning,
who ran with most surprising speed for him. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>ever,
McCann threw, and the runner was forced to
slide, which he did.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Frank encouragingly.
“Just see how easy it is.”</p>

<p>“Let him try it again!” muttered McCann sourly.
“Let anybody try it. See if I don’t git der next duffer
w’ot goes down.”</p>

<p>With Browning on second, Gamp longed to hit the
ball hard, and he succeeded in fouling it three times in
succession. Then he put up a long fly to right field,
on which Browning ran the moment the ball fell into
the hands of McGlinkey.</p>

<p>McGlinkey threw to Waldron, who wheeled about
with the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>Browning had covered ground with great speed and
was on his way from third to the home plate.</p>

<p>Uttering a low curse, McCann ran out after the ball,
caught it, and plunged back in a mad effort to stop the
score.</p>

<p>“Slide!” came from Merriwell, and Browning went
forward in a headlong plunge.</p>

<p>McCann jumped on Bruce with his full weight, but
Browning had scored.</p>

<p>“Dirty ball, dirty ball!” cried many voices. “Put
him out!”</p>

<p>Browning flung McCann aside and got up.</p>

<p>“If you try anything like that again,” said the big
fellow, “I’ll paralyze you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, g’wan!” sneered the catcher. “I’m playin’ der
game, dat’s all.”</p>

<p>“A dirty game.”</p>

<p>“Wot’s der matter? Youse chaps has knocked out
two of our men a’ready. Wotcher kickin’ fer?”</p>

<p>“So you are trying to get even. I think I’ll hit you
a few, anyhow!”</p>

<p>But Browning did not do so, for the players interfered
again.</p>

<p>“What a lovely, quiet game of baseball!” chirped
Jack Ready. “It’s a positive pleasure to take part in
such a game. I think somebody will get killed a few
times before the fracas is over.”</p>

<p>“But we have scored!” laughed Dick Merriwell.
“We are going to win!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that,” warned Carker dolefully.
“No game is won till it’s over.”</p>

<p>Swiftwing came up to the plate, but no one was on
a base ahead of him, and he simply put up a fly that
was easily handled at third.</p>

<p>The Merries, however, had made the first run.</p>

<p>“Wot’s der matter wid youse fellers?” said Bud
McCann as the home team came in to the bench. “Is
yer goin’ ter let dis gang of kids walk off wid der
game?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so much with your face, Bud,” came
from Robinson. “There is plenty of time. Wait till
the streak breaks and you’ll see the youngsters go all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
to pieces. That’s the way with young teams. I’ve
never seen one that could hang together and fight an
up-hill game against old stagers.”</p>

<p>“But we’re der ones wot has der up-hill game ter
fight.”</p>

<p>“They’ve made only one score.”</p>

<p>“Dat may be ernough fer dis kind of a game.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! We’ll make ten runs before we are
through, see if we don’t. All we have to do is to keep
right after them. See how hard we hit the ball last
time. Start it off, Maloney, by driving out a nice
little single.”</p>

<p>Maloney, the first hitter, vowed that he would, and
walked up to the plate with the air of a conqueror.</p>

<p>The first ball was an underhand rise, and the batter
popped it into the air, so that Merry easily handled
it when it came down. The first man was out. Maloney
swore beneath his breath as he retired to the
bench.</p>

<p>Flobert went after an out shoot, and up went another
infield fly, which Ready secured.</p>

<p>Nesbitt was not a heavy hitter, and Merry easily
caused him to fan at the first two.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” cried Ready. “They
go out in order just as fast as they get up to strike.”</p>

<p>Nesbitt, however, did not fan, as expected, but
drove a hot one at Dick Merriwell, who jumped for
it, failed to handle it, and let the runner reach first.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Dick ran back for the ball, which had gone through
him. Seeing this, Nesbitt started for second.</p>

<p>Dick got the ball, picked it up quickly, threw toward
second, but threw so high that the ball went ten feet
over Rattleton’s head.</p>

<p>Over second raced the runner, while both Browning
and Carson got after the ball, which was bounding
merrily away toward the fence.</p>

<p>Carson reached it first and saw Nesbitt crossing
third on the dead run. Nothing but a clean throw to
the plate would stop a score, and Berlin did his best
to make it. The throw was too high, Hodge being
forced to retreat a few feet to get the ball, and Nesbitt
crossed the pan with the score that tied.</p>

<p>Then the rooters for the home team vented their
delight with wild howls of joy, and Robinson said to
Hayward:</p>

<p>“We’ve got them going. If you can start right in
hitting, we’ll win the game in this inning.”</p>

<p>Hayward felt that this was true, and he stepped up
to the plate overflowing with confidence and determination.</p>

<p>Merry gave Robinson a drop, and the latter missed
it cleanly. Then, just when the fellow was looking
for a variation, Frank put over another of the same
kind and fooled him again. Hayward muttered something
to himself, and Frank laughed. The batter
gripped his stick, thinking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“He’ll waste the next two.”</p>

<p>Then, when he was expecting a “bender,” Frank
put the next one straight over, and Hayward let it
pass.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” came from the umpire.</p>

<p>Hayward savagely flung his bat aside, while the
great crowd cheered loudly.</p>

<p>Again Frank Merriwell was the first one to hit.</p>

<p>Bud McCann got close under the bat and gave the
signal to Nesbitt, who started with a high one. Frank
let it pass, and a ball was called.</p>

<p>Then the pitcher started one right at Merry, but
Frank fancied it would curve over, so he stood up
and swung to meet it. As he did so the hand of
McCann struck the bat aside, and Frank did not touch
the ball.</p>

<p>Merry turned and gave McCann a hard look. Then
he spoke to the umpire, saying:</p>

<p>“Mr. Umpire, will you please keep watch of this
man? He fouled my bat that time.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a lie!” cried the catcher. “I never touched
yer bat at all! Ye’re a big stiff if yer says so!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Bud!” cried Squinty. “I was watchin’,
an’ he is lyin’ erbout it!”</p>

<p>Frank felt like forcing the fellow to swallow his
words, but he wished no further trouble in the game,
and so he simply prepared to strike again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Budd McCann fancied'">Bud McCann fancied</ins> he had driven Merry into his
boots, and it gave him a feeling of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You’re a big blow!” he muttered loudly enough
for Frank to hear. “Wait till I git anodder chance
to t’ump yer! I’ll fix yer, see if I don’t!”</p>

<p>Nesbitt sent in a sharp curve, which Merry let pass,
as it was not over; but, to Frank’s dismay, the umpire
called another strike.</p>

<p>“Dat’s der stuff!” exclaimed the catcher. “He’s
easy, Nes. Put ’em right over der platter.”</p>

<p>But Merry was not at all nervous, and he forced the
pitcher to give him a good one that was right over.</p>

<p>Frank felt confident of meeting that ball and getting
a hit, but once more McCann touched his bat as
he swung, and he simply put up a foul, which the
tricky catcher easily captured.</p>

<p>Merry ran out and asked the umpire if he had not
seen McCann foul the bat again, but the official shook
his head and declared Frank out.</p>

<p>Merry came back and spoke to McCann.</p>

<p>“If you touch my bat again during the game,” he
said in a low tone, “I’ll have to hit you.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” blustered the ruffianly catcher. “I’d
like ter have yer try dat trick once more! I’d swat
der packin’s outer yer in less dan a jiffy!”</p>

<p>Merry longed to teach the fellow the lesson he deserved,
but his aversion for fighting prevented him
from getting into further trouble just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>Rattleton was not encouraged by what happened to
Merry, and he tunked an easy one down to Robinson,
who threw Harry out at first.</p>

<p>“W’y, we’re just beginnin’ ter play ball!” cried
McCann.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell stepped out from the bench, his
light, strong bat over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Der kid will be pie, Bud!” cried Squinty.</p>

<p>“You didn’t find him pie yesterday,” said a voice
from the bleachers, and the few who knew about the
encounter in front of the Continental Hotel laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>“I could lick dat babby ter-day,” thought Squinty.
“I’d jest like ter do der trick afore all dis crowd. Den
I guess dey wouldn’t laugh at me!”</p>

<p>He sat there, meditating on some manner of revenge.
The more he thought about it the greater became
his belief that he could easily whip Dick in another
encounter.</p>

<p>Dick was fooled by the second one Nesbitt put over,
and he missed it easily. Then followed one that was
just where the boy wanted it, though it came with
fearful speed.</p>

<p>The surprised spectators saw the lad strike at the
ball with the quickness of a veteran, the bat meeting
the sphere fairly. It was a pretty hit into left field,
and Dick ran with the speed of a frightened fawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Take another!” was the cry that sent him flying
over first and down to second.</p>

<p>He saw the left-fielder get the ball and throw, and
he heard Merry’s clear cry:</p>

<p>“Slide!”</p>

<p>Forward shot the boy, and the manner in which he
slid along the ground to the base was beautiful to see.
The baseman was a bit too late to touch him out, and
the umpire declared it safe.</p>

<p>“That’s Frank Merriwell’s brother!” cried a clear
voice in the grand stand. “What do you think of
him?”</p>

<p>“He’s all right!” shouted hundreds.</p>

<p>“They’re both off the same web!” roared a man on
the bleachers. “For his years the youngster is the
hottest stuff.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said Jack Ready, “I see where your
glory is about to be eclipsed. Listen to the words of a
prophet: That confounded kid is going to become
even more famous than his brother.”</p>

<p>“Good!” laughed Frank. “I am rather proud of
him now. If he keeps on, he’ll make a record for himself
in baseball some day.”</p>

<p>Ready walked out to strike. Nesbitt was angry, for
he felt that it was a disgrace to have a boy like Dick
make a two-bagger off him. He fancied he had discovered
Jack’s weak spot, and so he kept them in close
to Ready’s fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>Jack fouled two, and then he fell back far enough
to hit the ball fairly, sending it down between second
and third.</p>

<p>The moment the ball was hit Dick Merriwell was in
full leap for third, and the way he covered ground astonished
all witnesses. He tore up the dust and raced
over third without slackening speed in the least.</p>

<p>The right-fielder got the ball and sent it home.
Once more the remarkable boy hurled himself forward
and slid along the ground as if his body was greased.
That slide was something never forgotten by any one
who witnessed it, for it was made with perfect skill
and grace.</p>

<p>The ball came into the hands of McCann, who
dropped heavily on Dick’s head with his knees.</p>

<p>“Safe!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>But when McCann arose the boy lifted from the
ground a face that was stained with blood.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE ATHLETICS TAKE THE LEAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A roar arose from the crowd&mdash;a roar of anger at
the outrageous action of the ruffianly catcher. The
witnesses saw Frank Merriwell leap out from the
bench and dart toward McCann, and it seemed that a
thousand voices shouted:</p>

<p>“Go for him!”</p>

<p>Frank needed no urging. He might have restrained
himself under other circumstances, but the sight of
his brother’s bloody face had caused him to cast aside
all restraint.</p>

<p>McCann saw Merry coming and cast off the big
catching-mitt, whirling to face the furious brother of
the youth he had injured.</p>

<p>Not a word escaped Merry’s lips, but he went
straight at the ruffian. McCann stepped forward to
meet him, but Merry could no more be stopped than
could an avalanche under way. Frank found an opening
in the fellow’s guard and knocked him down instantly.</p>

<p>Up sprang the hard-headed bruiser, but he went
down as quick as he rose. Again McCann jumped up,
and again he went down. Each time he was knocked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
more than ten feet away, and Merriwell followed him
up closely.</p>

<p>As Merry struck the fellow the fourth time Squinty
Jim endeavored to get in and take part in the affray.
He made a dive for Merry, swinging a bat.</p>

<p>But a bloody-faced lad who had risen from the
ground was on hand to balk Squinty’s project, and
the young thug received a jolt under the ear that sent
him spinning to one side.</p>

<p>Then the players of both sides rushed in and the
fight was over.</p>

<p>The moment he realized everything that had happened
Frank Merriwell was very sorry.</p>

<p>“Before all these people!” he said. “It’s a shame!
They came here to witness a game of baseball, not a
prize-fight. Where is Dick?”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>Dick came up, wiping the blood from his face with
his handkerchief. One cheek was bruised and his
chin was cut.</p>

<p>“Hurt bad?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Not very,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I thought you must be. Your face looked bad
when that big brute got off your head.”</p>

<p>“He stunned me for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Methinks he hath been duly repaid,” chuckled
Ready. “He looks like a dish-rag about now.”</p>

<p>In truth, McCann was badly done up, and in no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
condition to catch further during that game. He had
found at last that he was no match for Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>So it was necessary to get yet another man into a
suit before the game could be continued.</p>

<p>Nick Robinson tried to excuse the action of McCann,
but he could not say much, and even his own
players would not back him up.</p>

<p>Frank, however, became more and more regretful
over what had happened.</p>

<p>“Never took part in any such disgraceful affair
on a ball-field before to-day,” he said. “I wonder
what people will think.”</p>

<p>Ready had reached second, and Carson came up
with great hopes of sending him home.</p>

<p>The new catcher’s name was Corday. He was a
tall fellow and a good thrower. He gave a sample of
his throwing when Ready played far off second on a
pitch. Down to the bag Corday lined the ball, and
Jack barely got back in time to escape being caught.</p>

<p>Carson managed to hit the ball all right, but the
left-fielder captured it, after a long run, and the first
half of the inning was over.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, we must shut them out and hold our
lead,” said Merriwell. “Everybody keep on his toes.”</p>

<p>McGlinkey was the first hitter, and he smashed the
second ball pitched, driving it along the ground past<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
second base. This was a good opening, and the rooters
for the home team opened up earnestly.</p>

<p>Waldron sacrificed McGlinkey to second in very
handsome style, and it began to look like a possible
score for the professionals.</p>

<p>Corday, however, was not a heavy hitter, and the
best he could do was to sacrifice the runner to third.</p>

<p>With two out, Webster came to the plate.</p>

<p>Hodge called for the double-shoot, but Merry shook
his head. Bart was puzzled, as Frank had ceased
using that curve after the first inning.</p>

<p>Webster was crafty and did not try to kill the ball.
Instead he hit it just hard enough to drop it over the
infield, and McGlinkey came racing home with the
score that tied.</p>

<p>Hodge was angry.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” he muttered to himself: “Merry
might have stopped that score. Why won’t he use the
double?”</p>

<p>“Hard luck, Merriwell,” grinned Robinson. “But
you have done very well for a youngster. You’ll make
a good pitcher with more experience.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Frank, aroused by the words of
the man.</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to strike out Robinson in short
order, saying, as Nick fanned the final time:</p>

<p>“Too bad, Mr. Robinson! You’ll make a batter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
some day, but you’ll have to learn to hit those easy
ones. Almost anybody ought to hit those.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” Robinson muttered, smiling sickly.</p>

<p>Again Frank sought to impart some of his energy
to his players as they came up to hit. Hodge started
well with a hit, but Browning flied to the infield.
Gamp fouled out, and Bart remained on first.</p>

<p>“They can’t hit him safely!” said Hodge to Frank,
who was coaching near first.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed Hayward, the baseman.
“You’ve obtained more hits off him now than you
ought to have.”</p>

<p>“Why, we haven’t begun to hit him!” said Merry.
“Wait till our streak comes.”</p>

<p>“You need it pretty soon, for the game is getting
along.”</p>

<p>“Lots of time. It’s not quite half-over.”</p>

<p>Nesbitt was well satisfied when he finally retired
the Merries without a man reaching second.</p>

<p>“Great pitching!” cried his admirers.</p>

<p>Again Merry went into the box and pitched steadily,
although two clean hits were made off him. He was
able to prevent anybody from scoring by his clever
work.</p>

<p>In the sixth one of Merry’s men got around to third,
but was left there.</p>

<p>Waldron was the first hitter for the professionals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
and he sent a hot one at Ready, who failed to get it
over in time to catch him at first.</p>

<p>Then Corday came up and sacrificed Waldron to
second.</p>

<p>Webster met the ball squarely and drove out a
two-bagger that sent Waldron home.</p>

<p>Once more the home team had taken the lead, but
that did not satisfy them, for Robinson sent out a
long fly, on which, after it was caught, Webster advanced
to third.</p>

<p>Two men were out, but the professionals had a
runner on third.</p>

<p>Again Bart called for the double-shoot. Again
Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>Maloney was fierce to get in a rap, and Frank hoped
to make him fan. But the center-fielder of the Athletics
managed to lift out a dinky hit that let Webster
come home with yet another run.</p>

<p>Frank resorted to speed now, and forced Flobert
to fan twice. Then he fooled the batter with one of
Nesbitt’s own, which was a slow ball that came up like
a lump of dough. Flobert hit it, but knocked it
straight into the hands of Ready, who took pains to
make his throw to first good.</p>

<p>The score was four to two in favor of the professionals.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">DICK’S TRIPLE PLAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I’d enjoy being kicked with a number fourteen
boot!” said Jack Ready, as he came in to the bench.
“I was the cause of that bunch of disaster. I should
have handled that grounder in time to get the man.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry over spilled milk,” advised Frank.
“The game is still on.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope so. I want a chance to redeem myself.”</p>

<p>“We must do some hitting,” growled Browning.
“It’s the only way to win games.”</p>

<p>“If by hitting you mean slugging, it’s not the only
way to win games,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve heard you say yourself that a heavy-hitting
team will beat a fast-fielding team in most
cases.”</p>

<p>“I acknowledge that,” nodded Merry; “but in close
games sacrifice-hitting and good base-running count.”</p>

<p>“Our sacrifice-hitting hasn’t counted much to-day.”</p>

<p>“It has given us two runs.”</p>

<p>“They have four.”</p>

<p>“Obtained mostly by sacrificing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to see us jump onto that pitcher’s
neck and hit him out to beat the band.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“So would I.”</p>

<p>“We can hit some.”</p>

<p>“When the streak is on.”</p>

<p>“Why not to-day?”</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to have a hitting streak, or this
pitcher bothers us.”</p>

<p>“Anybody ought to hit him.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Frank, “I fancy he is pretty good.”</p>

<p>Of a sudden, Ready uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“I know what ails us!” he palpitated.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Our mascot isn’t here!”</p>

<p>“Old Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Ask Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick was appealed to, and he explained that Crowfoot
had not felt like showing himself on the ball-ground,
his experience in Philadelphia having aroused
in him a desire to keep out of public view as much as
possible.</p>

<p>“If we don’t have that old boy before the game is
over it’s a gone case with us!” asserted Ready.
“We’ve got to have him! Carker, you must hie yourself
yonder and bring him hither.”</p>

<p>“He won’t come with me,” said Greg. “He doesn’t
like me much.”</p>

<p>“You must bring him, if you have to do it with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
aid of an officer. Lose no time, Gregory. Stop not
on the way to listen for the rumble of the approaching
earthquake. Grab Joseph by the collar and lead him
unto us.”</p>

<p>“Tell him I want him to come,” urged Dick. “That
will bring him if anything will.”</p>

<p>“Do you really wish me to go for him?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, you sad-faced socialist,” said Ready.
“Fly!”</p>

<p>“Give him this,” said Dick, passing to Greg a queer-looking
stone. “Tell him I sent it and asked that he
come to me without delay.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“He is pretty sure to be at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Take a cab,” instructed Merry. “I’ll pay for it.”</p>

<p>While Frank did not take much stock in mascots,
he felt that the appearance of the old Indian might
serve to arouse the players at a time when it would
be possible to win the game. So Greg hastened away,
leaving the ball-ground.</p>

<p>The game continued. The professionals had no
trouble in holding their lead up to the close of the
eighth inning.</p>

<p>Frank’s team came to the bat in the beginning of
the ninth with Ready up as a starter.</p>

<p>“Here is where we must do it!” exclaimed Frank.
“It takes two to tie and three to win. Let’s get right
into the game and make the runs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>Jack felt his nerves quiver as he walked out to the
plate, but he refused to go after the first high one
Nesbitt sent over.</p>

<p>Then the pitcher gave Ready a drop, which he failed
to touch. The third one looked good, and Jack hit it.
It went bounding merrily down the line toward first,
and Hayward gathered it in, touching the bag. One
man was out.</p>

<p>“Only two more, Nes!” cried the players on the
field.</p>

<p>“Where is Crowfoot?” groaned Ready, as he returned
to the bench.</p>

<p>“Carker couldn’t find him, I presume,” said Browning.</p>

<p>Berlin Carson walked out to the plate, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'like a lan'">like a lamb</ins>
to the sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Another victim!” cried the players.</p>

<p>Carson set his teeth.</p>

<p>“We’ll see!” he muttered, and then he smashed out
a long drive, which Webster dragged down.</p>

<p>Two men were out.</p>

<p>Rattleton began to pull on a sweater.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” ordered Frank sharply. “This game
isn’t over. Sit still until it is!”</p>

<p>“It’s just the same as over,” muttered Harry.
“We’re beaten in good shape.”</p>

<p>Hodge got up and advanced to the plate, his face
looking drawn and grim. Nesbitt laughed at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“Where will you have ’em?” he inquired. “Just
name the place, and I’ll put ’em right there.”</p>

<p>“Then put them over!” exclaimed Bart. “That’s all
I ask.”</p>

<p>“Here you go!”</p>

<p>The pitcher gave Hodge a drop, and Bart fouled
it. Then followed a rise, which Hodge did not touch,
and a strike was called.</p>

<p>“How easy, how easy!” cried the players.</p>

<p>Spectators were rising and preparing to leave the
field. Nesbitt put over another bender, and Bart
missed that. It was the second strike.</p>

<p>At this moment a strangely thrilling sound pealed
across the field. It was a wild, weird cry, and all
eyes were turned toward its source, which proved to
be an old Indian who had just come out through a
gate, accompanied by a youth in the uniform of Merriwell’s
players.</p>

<p>Nesbitt had swung his arm to deliver the ball when
that cry sounded. He seemed to hesitate the least bit,
and then he sent the sphere in.</p>

<p>Bart swung at it.</p>

<p>Crack!&mdash;the bat met the ball.</p>

<p>Again that wild cry pealed across the field, and
down to first shot Bart Hodge, while the fielders tried
in vain to reach his safe hit.</p>

<p>“Ye gods!” cried Jack Ready. “Our luck has
come! Did you see how the wind changed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid it changed too late,” came from Rattleton.</p>

<p>But Frank saw in this fortunate hit a possible chance
to win out, and he hurried down to first, where he began
coaching.</p>

<p>Browning came up to the plate, a flush in his cheeks.
He turned to look at Old Joe Crowfoot, and then
mentally exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hang me if I don’t believe he is good luck to us!
I am going to hit it!”</p>

<p>He did. He did not try to drive it far out, and for
that very reason he hit it handsomely, dropping it over
the infield and enabling him to reach first, while Bart
took second.</p>

<p>The crowd began to shout, for this unexpected
turn of affairs was enough to awaken their dormant
interest. Gamp stepped out, his teeth set and his eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>“It’s my tut-tut-tut-turn, by gum!” he said.</p>

<p>Nesbitt showed nervousness. His first one was
over, and Joe sent it skimming along the ground to the
short-stop. It was too hot for Robinson to handle
cleanly, and the bags were filled.</p>

<p>Frank rushed down to the bench, speaking to Swiftwing,
who stepped out with a bat.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit at a ball,” commanded Merry. “Let him
put them right over, but don’t swing at one of them.
He will give you a pass to first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>Nesbitt looked at Merry, who returned that glance
with interest, and something seemed to unnerve the
pitcher then and there.</p>

<p>Although he longed to strike at the ball, Swiftwing
obeyed Frank. Nesbitt tried to put the first one over,
but it was a ball, and a ball was called.</p>

<p>That made the pitcher more nervous than ever. He
took the utmost pains about the next one. It was a
strike.</p>

<p>“Drive it out!” shouted the crowd.</p>

<p>Swiftwing looked at Frank, but Merry shook his
head. Then, knowing the batter would not strike,
Nesbitt again took pains to put the ball over.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>Once more Swiftwing looked appealingly at Frank,
and once more Frank shook his head. The next one
was a ball, but still Nesbitt had plenty of time.</p>

<p>However, he failed to get the following one over,
and three balls were called.</p>

<p>Swiftwing gathered himself, gripping the bat as if
determined to hit the next one when it came over.</p>

<p>Frank rose and spoke quickly in a low tone.</p>

<p>“I tell you not to strike!” he said. “If the ball
comes right over, let it pass.”</p>

<p>Nesbitt was resolved to put it over, and he took his
time in making the delivery. As soon as the ball was
thrown, however, almost everybody saw it was not
good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>A roar that drowned the voice of the umpire went
up. The umpire motioned for Swiftwing to take his
base, and thus a run was forced in.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell was the next hitter. As he stepped
up to the plate he received an ovation that might have
rattled the nerve of a more excitable fellow.</p>

<p>“He’ll do it!” shouted many voices. “He’ll bring
in the winning runs!”</p>

<p>Nesbitt was frightened at last, and he could not find
the plate with the first two pitched. Then he sent in
a dead straight one that was right over.</p>

<p>Frank did not swing hard, but with all the skill at
his command he placed the ball in right field.</p>

<p>That hit did the work, for Browning and Gamp
came home, and the great crowd rose up and yelled its
delight.</p>

<p>Rattleton was nearly beside himself with joy, his
feelings having changed from deepest despair. He
rushed out with his bat, unheeding anything, and
swiped away at the very first ball. He fouled it, and
the catcher got under it.</p>

<p>Three men were out, but the Merries had the lead.</p>

<p>“Our mascot did it!” cried Jack Ready. “He came
just in time! Old Joe shall have a new plug of tobacco
to-night, or I’m a lobster!”</p>

<p>The game was not finished, however, for the heavy
hitters of the Athletics were next in order, and they
had their batting togs on. The first one was Webster,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
and he tapped out a little single. Robinson followed
with a scratch hit, and once more the excitement was
feverish.</p>

<p>No one was out. Maloney came out from the bench
swinging his favorite stick.</p>

<p>“Slug it, old boy!” cried somebody. “Merriwell’s
arm is gone. You can hit it a mile!”</p>

<p>Frank was cautious, but again shook his head when
Bart called for the double-shoot. He tried an out
drop, but Maloney let it pass.</p>

<p>“One ball!”</p>

<p>Then Merry tried an in shoot.</p>

<p>“Two balls!”</p>

<p>Frank ventured to put one straight over the inside
corner.</p>

<p>Maloney hit it hard, and the ball went whistling like
a bullet through the air.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Dick Merriwell leaped high from the
ground and caught it with both hands. It was an
amazing catch, but what followed was more surprising.</p>

<p>The moment the boy’s feet touched the ground again
he sprang toward second, which Rattleton had not
covered.</p>

<p>The runner had started off second at the crack of
the ball and bat, while Robinson had raced down
from first.</p>

<p>In vain the runner tried to stop and get back. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
boy went past him and tagged the bag, thus putting
Webster out.</p>

<p>Astounded beyond expression, Robinson had
stopped and turned about to get back to first.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing the ball to first, the swift-footed
lad ran Robinson down the base-line and tagged him
with the ball, thus completing a triple play unassisted.</p>

<p>The score was 5 to 4 in favor of the Merries.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CHALLENGE OF MR. HAZARD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“‘Mr. Jack Hazard,’” said Frank Merriwell, reading
the name on the card that had been brought him
by the bell-boy.</p>

<p>“Another Jack?” exclaimed Jack Ready. “What,
ho! Who is the gent, Merry?”</p>

<p>“Ask me!” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“From thy manner I should infer that thou art well
acquainted with him&mdash;not.”</p>

<p>“The inference would be correct.”</p>

<p>“Me curiosity is awakened. Prithee let him enter,
and banish me not from thy presence. He may be
some bold bad man who is seeking to do thee harm,
in which case it behooves thee to have a faithful friend
at hand.”</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, let up on that kind of chatter! It becomes
tiresome after a while.”</p>

<p>Then Frank turned to the bell-boy and directed
that Mr. Hazard be brought up.</p>

<p>Merriwell and his friends had reached New York
on their triumphal baseball tour, and they were stopping
at the Herald Square Hotel.</p>

<p>The arrival of Frank Merriwell had been noted by
the newspapers, several of which had contained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
lengthy interviews with him. In these interviews
Merry had stated that his ball-team would disband in
New York, as the end of the season was reached and
they had no desire to play longer. For himself, he
declared that he had no intention of becoming a professional
ball-player, although he had received offers
from both the big leagues. The rumor that he would
sign or had signed with New York for the coming
season was entirely groundless. He had watched with
great interest the manner in which New York had
worked a remarkable young college pitcher during the
season just closing, and had decided that it would
take a man with an arm of iron to withstand the strain
and remain in form. Besides that, he had not the
least desire to become a professional, finding far more
satisfaction and pleasure in purely amateur sport.</p>

<p>The interviewers had not failed to ask questions
concerning Dick Merriwell, who had received no small
amount of advertising. Dick was spoken of as a “Boy
Wonder,” with astonishing speed and bewildering
curves, who had shown himself capable of pitching
against some of the fastest teams in the country and
winning his games with good support. It was said
that his jump ball fooled the surest batter, and that
it might in time become quite as well known as Frank
Merriwell’s double-shoot. The romantic story of Merriwell’s
discovery of his brother was also told.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'As  ult, large'">As a result, large</ins> crowds of curiosity-seekers hung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
around the hotel, seeking to catch a glimpse of Frank
or Dick, not a little to the annoyance of both.</p>

<p>“He’ll turn out to be another chap who wants to
see you just a moment for nothing in particular,” said
Ready. “You should have demanded his business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can stand another one,” smiled Merry. “Let
him come.”</p>

<p>In a few moments there was a rap at the door, and
Frank called, “Come in.”</p>

<p>The door opened to admit a rather remarkable-appearing
man, with the face of a youth of twenty and
the white hair of a man of sixty. He was dressed in
the very height of fashion and carried a cane. His
smooth cheeks were ruddy with the flush of health,
and his blue eyes were clear as an unclouded sky.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” he said, advancing as Frank rose,
“I beg your pardon, sir; I knew you must be annoyed
by the crowds hanging about. I feared you might decline
to see me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hazard?” questioned Frank pleasantly.</p>

<p>“That is my name.”</p>

<p>“If you had stated your business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I did not for fear you would decline to see me.”</p>

<p>“Is it, then, so unpleasant?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope not; but I saw by the papers that you
intend to play no more baseball this season, and that
your team will disband here.”</p>

<p>“Which is correct.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“As my business is connected with baseball, and I
hope to induce you to change your mind, I thought
it best to meet you before making a statement.”</p>

<p>Merry smiled again.</p>

<p>“I fear you are giving yourself too much trouble,”
he said.</p>

<p>“At least, you will not decline to talk the matter
over?”</p>

<p>“No; but I am tired of baseball. The first cool days
of autumn have given me a desire for sport of a different
order, yet no less exciting.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Football.”</p>

<p>“Will you play this fall?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say, as I am out of college; but I shall be
interested in the sport, and I expect to do some coaching.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind saying where?”</p>

<p>“I have no objections. I have been invited to coach
the team at Fardale, where I once attended school. As
I hope to enter my brother there this fall, I shall accept
the invitation.”</p>

<p>“Your brother&mdash;he is the youthful pitcher concerning
whom the papers had so much to say this morning.
The story of your meeting with him was most
romantic.”</p>

<p>Now Merry frowned a bit.</p>

<p>“In many particulars the story was not quite ac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>curate,”
he declared. “I saw the reporters were determined
to tell some kind of a yarn about it, and I
gave them the bare facts. They were not satisfied,
and some of them resorted to imagination in their
elaboration of the particulars.”</p>

<p>Jack Ready had remained in the background, but
now he stirred slightly, upon which Merriwell at once
introduced him to the visitor.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hazard,” said Jack, bowing profoundly. “I
see you are delighted to meet me. It is a great honor.
You may tell your grandchildren about it as they
gather about your knees.”</p>

<p>Hazard regarded the queer fellow with a puzzled
expression.</p>

<p>“This is our third-baseman,” said Frank. “He is a
very entertaining chap, both on the diamond and off.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Merry,” chirped Ready. “So good of you
to say it.”</p>

<p>“Occasionally,” Frank added, “he is taken for a
fool, but I assure you, Mr. Hazard, he is simply an
idiot.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Jack; “but even my long
suffering has a limit. Don’t you dare call me a lunatic.”</p>

<p>“Is he dangerous?” smiled Hazard.</p>

<p>“Perfectly harmless,” assured Merry.</p>

<p>Hazard took a seat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” he said, “you have been very suc<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>cessful
in baseball this season, but I think I know
why.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” nodded Ready. “It’s because he is
it.”</p>

<p>“I admit that Mr. Merriwell is a good pitcher, but
you must have encountered some good twirlers during
your tour.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“And you have defeated some of the fastest amateur
and professional teams in the whole country.”</p>

<p>“Correct.”</p>

<p>“Now, I think I know why. In every case you have
been too swift for the amateurs.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And the professionals have made the mistake of
underrating you. They have fancied they could defeat
you without doing their level best, and that has
led them into the bad mistake of not playing from the
start in their best form. This has given you opportunities
to win your games before they awakened to the
fact that it was necessary for them to work hard.”</p>

<p>“Have you taken notice of the scoring of the games
by innings?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“Not particular notice.”</p>

<p>“I thought not. If you had, you would have seen
that we have won almost every game in the final innings,
those with the professionals being no exceptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
to those with the amateurs. By the time they had
played six or seven innings the most of these teams
should have discovered what they were up against.”</p>

<p>“Possibly so,” nodded the visitor, “but professionals
generally fancy they can win out against amateurs
at any stage of the game. I am satisfied that this has
caused you to win more than one hard game against
professionals. They have neglected their opportunities.
Now, Mr. Merriwell, I am here to make you a
proposition. I have a baseball-team that I regard
quite as fast as yours, or faster. It is made up of
college men mainly, with a few others&mdash;and none of
the others are professionals.</p>

<p>“I am confident that my team can defeat your team&mdash;so
confident that I challenge you to a game on the
Polo Grounds to-morrow afternoon at half-past three.
I hope you will have the courage to accept after defeating
so many teams this season, as I am sure the game
must draw a large attendance here. New York is anxious
to see you play, and the fans will be out in force.
I will see that it is advertised as your final game for
the season, and we will play on any terms you may see
fit to name, the winning team to take seventy-five per
cent. of the gate-money&mdash;or the whole of it. You
cannot say this is not fair, and I think you cannot afford
to refuse.”</p>

<p>Merry was silent for some moments, looking
straight at Mr. Hazard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“What team is this you wish us to meet?” he finally
asked.</p>

<p>“I call it The Mysteries.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” cried Ready, with a flourish. “Refuse
me! My rubber-neck disposition is aroused.”</p>

<p>“How do we know this is on the level?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“I am well known to the proprietor of this hotel
and to a number of men in the city who will assure
you that my word is reliable. You shall have such
references as you desire. If I cannot satisfy you in
every particular, you need not play the game.”</p>

<p>“But how about the Polo Grounds?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing going on there to-morrow, unless
we play, and I have been assured that I may have
the grounds.”</p>

<p>“Then you put yourself to the trouble of finding
that out before coming to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You must have fancied there was some prospect
that I would play with you?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because you have the reputation of being ready
for almost anything in the way of honest, straightforward
sport, and several of my team assured me that
there was not the least doubt but you would meet us
when you understood the matter fully.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>“You say there are a number of college men on
your team who know me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do I know them?”</p>

<p>“You do.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>Jack Hazard smiled in a mysterious manner.</p>

<p>“I had rather not state, Mr. Merriwell,” he said,
“but I assure you that there is a big surprise in store
for you if you accept my proposition. My men know
you like a book, and they feel confident that they can
defeat your team.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said Ready solemnly, “it behooves us
to remove some of their confidence. We must get
against the festive Mysteries and bump ’em hard.”</p>

<p>“Then you will play the game?” questioned Hazard.</p>

<p>“If I find your references satisfactory,” said Frank,
“we will play the game to-morrow, which shall be our
last game for the season.”</p>

<p>“Good!” laughed the visitor. “You’re beaten!”</p>

<p>“Nit!” chuckled Ready.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="fs70">A HOMESICK BOY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sights of New York filled Dick Merriwell with
wonder and awe. Brought up in the peace and quietude
of Pleasant Valley, under the shadow of the
snow-capped Rockies, the rush and roar of the great
city overwhelmed the boy at first. The tall buildings
filled him with fear, the rush and racket of the elevated
trains shocked him, the whiz of the clanging surface
cars sent cold shivers over his body.</p>

<p>Although he did not confess it, he was seized by a
great longing to fly from the mighty city and return
to his quiet home near Lake Sunshine. The feeling
smote upon his heart with a pain that took away his
strength and made him sick. He thought of Felicia
far away, and longed to look into her bright eyes
again&mdash;longed to feel her caressing arms flung about
him.</p>

<p>But he had given up everything that once was his
to go with Frank and do what Frank desired, and he
fought against the terrible homesickness. No one
seemed to read him like Old Joe Crowfoot, the withered
Indian, who loved him with the affection of a devoted
animal.</p>

<p>If Old Joe sickened and longed for the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
and plains, he kept the fact concealed beneath a calm
demeanor and a stoical countenance. But he found
the boy quite alone in the solitude of his room in the
hotel, and placed a wrinkled hand on his shoulder,
saying with surprising softness:</p>

<p>“Heap bad feel now&mdash;git over him bimeby. Old
Joe him know. You wait.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” gasped the boy, starting and trembling.
“I did not hear you come in.”</p>

<p>“Injun Heart lose all Joe he teach um to know.
Always must hear. Never be ketched surprise.”</p>

<p>“But I was thinking, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Better not think more of that. Heap bad. Forget.”</p>

<p>“You, Joe&mdash;you tell me to forget?” cried the boy,
in amazement. “Why, it was not long ago you tried
to make me remember. You would not let me forget.
You told me of the sunlight playing on the bosom of
the lake I love&mdash;of the moonshine making a silver
path across the water. You told me of the birds, and
squirrels, and wild things I used to call round me.
You told me of the silent mountains piled against
the sky. And then you told me of Felicia, Little Star
Eyes, whom I heard calling to me night after night in
my dreams. It was you who aroused my mad longing
to go back to my home&mdash;and to Felicia!”</p>

<p>Gravely Old Joe squatted on the carpeted floor, taking
out his black pipe and beginning to fill it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Heap so,” he confessed.</p>

<p>“But now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Heap diffrunt.”</p>

<p>“You want me to forget those things&mdash;you, you?”
panted Dick, starting up and staring at the cool redskin.
“It’s not like you, Joe!”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the old fellow, as he stuffed the
tobacco into the bowl of the pipe. “No git excite’.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it! This city lays on me like an awful
load. It is more terrible than anything of which I
ever dreamed! Sometimes, when on the street, I feel
that I am being crowded and smothered, and I have
hard work to breathe.”</p>

<p>“Bad for you,” said Crowfoot, producing a match;
“heap wuss for me. You young; me old. I live heap
long time where plent’ room. City crowd big much.”</p>

<p>“Yet you make no murmur; offer no complaint!”</p>

<p>“What use? Joe him come with Injun Heart.
Him know it be hard for Injun Heart. Why him
make it wuss?”</p>

<p>“Joe, Joe! you are so good! You think of me, not
of yourself! And still you tell me to forget Felicia
and my dear home!”</p>

<p>Crowfoot gravely lighted his pipe, puffing forth
big whiffs of smoke, and then threw the burning match
upon the carpet. Dick quickly picked it up and tossed
it in a cuspidor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>“Joe him your friend,” said the old fellow. “You
know.”</p>

<p>“I have thought you my friend&mdash;I know, Joe. You
have been my friend. But you love the great West,
where there is plenty of room. You feel the awful
crowding of the city.”</p>

<p>“Steady Hand him your broder.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he is used to all this; I am not. With
me it is different. And what you told me is true, Joe&mdash;what
you told me of the men of the East. They are
not big, and strong, and healthy; they dress in fine
clothes, wear high collars, and look weak. They are
all striving to become rich. That is all they think
about. And it costs so much money to live here!”</p>

<p>“Heap big lot,” nodded Joe.</p>

<p>“My brother wants to make me like them! I do
not wish to live that way.”</p>

<p>“Him different,” said Old Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Dick, “he does seem different in
many ways, and yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“White man different from red man. Steady Hand
him know what best for Injun Heart.”</p>

<p>“How you have changed, Joe! Once you told me he
would spoil me, but now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That when Joe him think Steady Hand not do
right thing. Joe him think odder way now. Steady
Hand him no fool; him know what best for Injun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Heart. You do what him say. Joe hate him once.
Think him take Injun Heart away.”</p>

<p>“But now Frank has won even you for a friend, and
there was a time when you longed to kill him! He
seems to have a way of making friends of everybody.”</p>

<p>The old Indian nodded gravely, continuing to puff
at his pipe.</p>

<p>“Right,” he admitted. “Joe he know it. He know
it all the time. Him see how ev’rybody think Steady
Hand be heap smart.”</p>

<p>“And you advise me to do as he wishes me to?”</p>

<p>“That so.”</p>

<p>“But Felicia&mdash;am I to see her no more?” cried the
boy, in a heart-broken way.</p>

<p>“Some time.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Soon mebbe.”</p>

<p>“How can I? I am not to go to her.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe she come.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I shall never see her any more! And
Frank says I am to begin going to school very soon.”</p>

<p>“Make you like him, heap good school.”</p>

<p>More than ever was the boy amazed.</p>

<p>“Why, you told me many times that no school was
good! You have changed, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe some. I know Steady Hand now much
better. Good school make man like him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“And you think it will do me good to go to school
there?”</p>

<p>“Guess so some.”</p>

<p>Dick made a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have to go!” he said dejectedly. “I’ll
have to do it, even if it kills me!”</p>

<p>“No kill; make man. Mebbe you not be like Old
Joe thought you be some time; you be like Steady
Hand, that much good.”</p>

<p>“When you say that I know what it means. I shall
do it, Joe. But you will stay near, won’t you? Promise
that you will.”</p>

<p>“Stay long as can stand him. Steady Hand say
Joe can stay. Bimeby Joe him git much sick for
mountains and prairies. Then him go ’way.”</p>

<p>“And never come back?” cried Dick.</p>

<p>“Mebbe so some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you never will! If you go away, Joe, I’ll
never see you again!”</p>

<p>“Not gone yit.”</p>

<p>“But you said you might.”</p>

<p>“Wait. Trouble him come soon if not hurry um.
Joe him go with you to place where school be. Him
want to see um place.”</p>

<p>“But if I do not wish to stay there, Joe&mdash;what if it
makes me sick and I want to get away?”</p>

<p>“Then mebbe we do somethin’.”</p>

<p>“You will help me run away, Joe?” panted the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>The old redskin smoked in silence for some moments,
finally answering:</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You won’t? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Promise Steady Hand.”</p>

<p>“But it is for me, Joe&mdash;for me!”</p>

<p>“Joe him give Steady Hand promise; never break
it. Steady Hand him say Joe may go with you, but
him must never git you run away. Joe him promise.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use!” Dick murmured. “I see that I’ll
have to do as he wishes me to. I must give up! Oh,
I wish he had never found me! Sometimes I think I
hate him!”</p>

<p>“Bad mistake. Injun Heart no hate Steady Hand.
He ready to fight for Steady Hand. Only think him
hate some time. Somebody hurt Steady Hand, him
fight heap much.”</p>

<p>Deep down in his heart Dick Merriwell knew this
was true. Still, the homesickness that had seized him
would not depart, and not even the words of Old Joe
could banish it.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">BEFORE THE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jack Hazard proved an adept advertiser. The
morning papers on the following day were “worked”
scientifically for space, and a number of them told how
Merriwell’s team had been challenged by the manager
of another team made up mainly of fast college men,
many of them knowing Merriwell well and being able
to bat him hard. Still, in relation to the challenging
team an air of mystery was maintained, and the name
of not one player was mentioned.</p>

<p>Merriwell and his team reached the Polo Grounds
early and entered their dressing-room, where they
proceeded to change their street attire for baseball uniforms,
taking their time about doing so.</p>

<p>“This is the first time in baseball,” said Merry, “that
I ever went up against a team I knew absolutely nothing
about. It’s a very remarkable affair, to say the
least.”</p>

<p>“It has piqued my curiosity till I feel decidedly
peaked,” put in Ready. “I wouldn’t be a bit surprised
to find out we were up against a lot of old leaguers.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is the New York team,” rumbled
Browning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>“There are lots of college men on the New Yorks!”
laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“One, anyhow,” said Carson.</p>

<p>“And they have nearly witched his ping off&mdash;I mean
pitched his wing off,” from Rattleton.</p>

<p>“It is not the Giants,” decided Merry. “But it’s a
hot team, and I’ll bet almost anything on it. I understand
there is betting on the game. Somebody must
know the kind of a bunch we’re up against, else
there’d be no taking chances.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Carson, “that the odds are
against us.”</p>

<p>“Who is flashing all the boodle?” inquired Ready.
“If I can find the sports, I may venture a mere bagatelle
of eight or ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Gambling is a vicious thing,” declared Greg Carker.
“It is the cause of no end of poverty and suffering.
The rich man gambles, and the poor man follows
his example. Thus the rich man pushes the poor
man still lower. It is the duty of all who have at
heart the welfare of their fellow creatures to frown on
the vice.”</p>

<p>“Lecture by G. Carker, promoter of earthquakes!”
chirped Ready. “Unplug your ears and listen.”</p>

<p>“How is your arm, Merry?” asked Hodge, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“Rather poor,” confessed Frank. “I’ve never recovered
from that sprained wrist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“But you can pitch to-day?”</p>

<p>“If absolutely necessary. We’ll find out first what
sort of a gathering we are to encounter.”</p>

<p>“You must pitch! It’ll never do to run Dick against
a powerful Eastern team.”</p>

<p>“There are just as fast teams in the West.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but there is something the matter with
Dick. Haven’t you noticed it?”</p>

<p>“He’s a trifle rattled by New York.”</p>

<p>“It’s worse than that.”</p>

<p>“Worse? How?”</p>

<p>“I believe he is homesick.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but he’ll get over that. Wait till the
game starts and he gets into it. He’ll forget everything
but baseball.”</p>

<p>Still Bart urged Frank to go into the box. Hodge
had the utmost confidence in Merry, even though
Frank’s wrist was lame.</p>

<p>The time came for them to go out onto the field.
Old Joe had been silently smoking in the dressing-room,
but, at the last moment before going out, he
spoke to Dick.</p>

<p>“Play heap smart to-day,” he said. “Show what
um can do. You give um big s’prise.”</p>

<p>“I do not feel like playing baseball,” confessed the
boy. “I cannot forget Pleasant Valley and home.”</p>

<p>“Great warrior him forgit ev’rything. You got Injun
heart. No forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>Then he touched the boy in a queer way with his
hand, and Dick straightened up, saying:</p>

<p>“I’ll not forget it, Joe. I’ll try not to make you
ashamed of me, see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Much good!” grunted Crowfoot.</p>

<p>“You are to sit on the bench with us,” said Dick.
“Frank said you were.”</p>

<p>“Joe him be there.”</p>

<p>“When I feel like quitting I shall look to you. I
shall think of the things you have taught me. That
will make me play.”</p>

<p>“Injun Heart do that same as if him life be on
game and him make um much wonder.”</p>

<p>“I will! I will!”</p>

<p>“Are you ready, fellows?” called the voice of Merriwell.</p>

<p>“All ready.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go out. Come on.”</p>

<p>They followed him, and soon discovered that a great
throng of people had gathered on the bleachers and
in the grand stand, while a steady stream was coming
through the gate.</p>

<p>As Merry’s team appeared a shout went up.</p>

<p>“There they are!”</p>

<p>“There’s Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“Hooray for Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“’Rah! ’rah! ’rah!”</p>

<p>Round the field ran the cheering. It was a surpri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>sing
reception for Merriwell to receive there in New
York, and he afterward confessed that it “bumped”
him.</p>

<p>But when the general shouting had ceased there
came another sound from the bleachers on the right of
the field. It was the Yale cheer, ending with Merriwell’s
name, and it was shouted through more than a
hundred megaphones in perfect chorus.</p>

<p>Frank looked, and there, gathered in a body, were a
great throng of Yale men. Where they had come
from he could not understand, but they were there,
and they cheered for the hero of Old Eli, led by several
men, who wildly flourished their arms.</p>

<p>But what surprised Frank more than aught else was
the fact that in the midst of these men were two girls,
dressed in white, wearing the Yale blue and flaunting
Yale banners.</p>

<p>At sight of them Frank almost staggered. Then he
stood quite still and stared hard.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he gasped. “Can it be?”</p>

<p>He found it difficult to believe the evidence of his
eyes, but a moment later he joyously muttered:</p>

<p>“Inza and Elsie! They are here together!”</p>

<p>He grasped Bart and turned him toward the group,
saying hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Look there, Hodge! It will do your eyes good!”</p>

<p>Bart saw them, and his dark face flushed, while his
eyes gleamed with untold pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“Elsie!” he breathed. “At last!”</p>

<p>“Talk about surprises!” said Merry. “Isn’t this
one?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” Hodge admitted, waving his hand to the
girls.</p>

<p>They waved back, both of them almost beside themselves
with delight.</p>

<p>“Where are our antagonists?” inquired Jack Ready,
looking around.</p>

<p>“They will be ready to practise directly,” said the
smooth voice of Mr. Hazard, as that individual appeared.
“You may take the field first, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get out, fellows,” said Frank, recovering himself.</p>

<p>At a signal Merry’s team trotted onto the field for
practise. Dick Merriwell went out at short, which
made it apparent that Frank intended to pitch.</p>

<p>The practise of the team was sharp and snappy from
the very first, and it brought frequent bursts of applause
from the witnesses.</p>

<p>Old Joe Crowfoot was on the bench, still pulling at
his pipe, after his usual calm manner.</p>

<p>Dick quickly entered into the work, and his cleverness
in handling everything that came his way showed
that he was pretty fast, in spite of his years.</p>

<p>After nearly fifteen minutes of practise Frank called
his team in. Barely had the men walked in to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
bench, when out from the dressing-room came the
other team. They were dressed in yellow uniforms,
and they trotted straight out onto the field.</p>

<p>Then from the Yale crowd came another cheer.
Frank Merriwell was, indeed, surprised.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he gasped. “What have they
sprung on us? Will you look at that crowd?”</p>

<p>“I will,” nodded Jack Ready. “But I’m nearly
knocked stiff with the blow. There’s Gene Skelding
on third!”</p>

<p>“And Starbright on first!” from Hodge.</p>

<p>“Mason at short!” rumbled Browning.</p>

<p>“Oliver Packard on second!” ejaculated Carson.</p>

<p>“Dud-dud-Dismal Jones in left field!” stammered
Gamp.</p>

<p>“Hans Dunnerwurst in right!” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Barney Mulloy catching!” gasped Rattleton.</p>

<p>“Ephrum Gug-gug-gug-Gallup out in center!” said
Gamp.</p>

<p>“And Dade Morgan for a pitcher!” muttered
Hodge.</p>

<p>The Mysteries were made up of Frank Merriwell’s
former comrades and college friends.</p>

<p>When he had recovered from his astonishment Merry
began to laugh.</p>

<p>“This is a fine old joke!” he said. “It’s a put-up
job! Now I begin to understand the meaning of that
collection of Yale fans. This thing was cut and dried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
in advance. Well, there will be warm doings around
here to-day.”</p>

<p>“And we propose to do your team, Mr. Merriwell,”
said Jack Hazard, who had approached Frank.
“These fellows know you, and they say you will be
easy, as your team is not nearly as strong as ours.”</p>

<p>This caused Frank to laugh again.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing to have plenty of confidence,”
he observed, “but I think I’ll take a turn at surprising
somebody.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“If you wait a while you will find out.”</p>

<p>The practise of the Mysteries was quite as sharp
and snappy as that of Merriwell’s team had been, setting
the crowd to speculating once more.</p>

<p>Morgan began to warm up to pitch, but Frank
tossed a ball to Dick, saying:</p>

<p>“Loosen up your wing a trifle, Richard, while I
flip with Mr. Hazard to see who starts the game.”</p>

<p>They drew aside, and Hazard spun a coin, which
twinkled in the afternoon sunshine when it fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Heads!” Merry had said.</p>

<p>“Heads it is,” said Hazard. “Your choice.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take our outs.”</p>

<p>“Good! We’ll fall on you in the first inning hard
enough to give you some worriment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>Dick was throwing to Hodge, and Merry passed
him on his way to speak to Mulloy and Morgan.</p>

<p>“Frankie, it’s a soight fer sore oies to see yez!” exclaimed
Barney, who had grown stocky and muscular.
“Oi’m glad to grasp yer fin again, me bhoy.”</p>

<p>Merry shook hands with Barney.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you,” he declared. “How did
you fellows patch up this piece of business?”</p>

<p>The Irish youth grinned and winked.</p>

<p>“It’s watchin’ yez we’ve been,” he confessed; “an’
we loaded a gun fur yez whin ye got this way. Oi
hate t’ do it, Frankie, but we’ll have t’ beat yez this
day.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lose any sleep over that,” returned Merry.</p>

<p>He met Morgan, extending his hand.</p>

<p>“Dade, I presume you’re going to pitch against us?”
he said.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” said Morgan, with that sweet smile,
his eyelids drooping. “But it’s to be clean sport.”</p>

<p>“I should hope so, with these teams playing. Still,
I can understand that it will be for blood.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>After the regular practise, the Mysteries came in
from the field. Some little time was spent in handshaking,
while the great bunch of Yale men on the
bleachers sang, “Here’s to Good Old Yale.”</p>

<p>Hans Dunnerwurst toddled up to Merry, extending
his pudgy hand, as he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“How you vos, ain’d id? You vos glatness to seen
me, I pelief. Yaw! I’d peen a regular surprising
barty. Yaw!”</p>

<p>“And you still have the idea that you can play ball?”
said Merry. “Why, Hans, you know better!”</p>

<p>“Vait!” squawked the Dutch lad. “Vait till I show
you vot I can dood! You vill peen so surbrised dot
your eyes vill sdick oudt uf mine headt.”</p>

<p>“You always did have a barrel of luck,” said Merry,
“but luck will not win this game.”</p>

<p>“The Lord be with us!” droned Dismal Jones, his
face as long as ever. “How are you, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Gol-darn my squash!” cried Ephraim Gallup, as
he came straddling up. “I’m glad I’m not to hum
on the farm, b’gosh!”</p>

<p>Starbright was on hand to grasp Merry’s hand in
both his own broad palms, his blue eyes beaming. Mason
came round quietly, and Oliver Packard made no
demonstration.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the voice of the umpire.</p>

<p>Out onto the field trotted Merriwell’s team.</p>

<p>And, to the astonishment of everybody, Frank Merriwell
did not go into the pitcher’s box.</p>

<p>He sent Dick in!</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">HITTING ’EM SOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Pwhat’s this?” cried Barney Mulloy, in amazement.
“It’s a choild ye put agin’ us? It’s no joke,
ye’ll foind it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you,” laughed Frank. “When
you’ve batted him out of the box, I’ll hand you up a
few twisters.”</p>

<p>“Thin ye’ll have a chance roight away,” returned
the Irish youth confidently.</p>

<p>There was a hush after the cheering, and the game
was about to begin.</p>

<p>“Battery for the Merries, Merriwell and Hodge,”
announced the umpire.</p>

<p>There was a volley of applause, and Dick Merriwell
toed the slab. He looked slender and out of place
there, his face pale and his dark eyes gleaming, while
there was a set expression about his somewhat wilful
mouth. Up among the clustered Yale men there was
a buzz of comment.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame to drive such a gentle lamb to the
slaughter!” said one.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” agreed another. “Why, that
boy can’t hold down Morgan’s team!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>“Merriwell must be daffy to put his brother into
such a position,” asserted a third. “Can it be that he
is afraid to face Morgan’s men?”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Inza Burrage at once. “Anybody
here knows better than that. When was Frank Merriwell
ever afraid of anything? Dick Merriwell is his
brother, and he will win this game.”</p>

<p>On the edge of the gathered Yale men a man arose
and said:</p>

<p>“If there are any betting men present, I’ll chance a
few dollars that the boy does not remain in the box
four innings.”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow-wow!” barked a huge St. Bernard dog
at the side of the speaker.</p>

<p>“Correct, Nero!” cried the man approvingly. “You
agree with me, I see. That settles it. The boy will
be batted out within four innings. I’ll bet five, ten,
twenty, fifty, or a hundred on it.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t somebody take him?” breathed Inza,
her cheeks flushed. “Frank Merriwell knows what he
is about, and he would not put his brother into the
box to be batted out in four innings. If I were a man,
I’d bet just as much as that gentleman wants to wager!”</p>

<p>Those words seemed to arouse some of the Yale
crowd, and there was a low buzzing of voices.</p>

<p>“She’s right,” said more than one. “Merriwell
knows what he is about. The kid will stay in more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
than four innings. Let’s call the gentleman with the
long green.”</p>

<p>Whereupon there was a hasty plunging into pockets,
and the students quickly formed a pool, handing their
money over in fives and tens to one of their number.</p>

<p>“Come, come!” cried the man with the dog; “will
no one take me? Then I’ll make it three innings. The
boy will not be in the box for Yale at the end of the
first half of the third inning. Here is a cool hundred
that says so.”</p>

<p>A Yale man pushed his way through, saying:</p>

<p>“I think I’ll have to cover your century, sir. Will
you be good enough to nominate the stakeholder?”</p>

<p>“You?” sneered the man with the dog, looking at
the beardless student. “Why, when did you ever see
a hundred?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll put your money up, I’ll guarantee to cover
it.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s make it something worth while!” exclaimed
the fellow, who had heavy black eyebrows and
a deeply lined face. “A hundred is too small. Let’s
make it two hundred.”</p>

<p>Now it happened that the Yale men had placed very
nearly two hundred dollars in the hands of the man
deputized to place the bet, and he at once said:</p>

<p>“That is quite satisfactory to me.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the man.</p>

<p>“Put up your money,” said the Yale man quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
“or close up your countenance. Here is a gentleman
who will hold the stakes. It is Robert Harding, of
New Haven, known to everybody. You cannot object
to him as a stakeholder.”</p>

<p>The man with the dog hesitated, frowning blackly.
The dog barked again.</p>

<p>“All right, Nero,” said the fellow. “It seems a
shame to rob this tender young lamb of his boodle, but
he wants to give it away, and I need it. Mr. Harding,
here is my money.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” cried the man with the dog. “A fine job?
See them bump the kid now!”</p>

<p>Just then Dick Merriwell sent the first ball over,
and it seemed slow enough for the batter to hit it
easily. Packard missed it clean, however, and Jack
Ready cried:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s just as easy, Richard! You’ll keep that
lad swatting the ozone all day, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Give him another, Dick,” urged Carson from right
field.</p>

<p>“That’s pitching ’em some,” rumbled Browning.</p>

<p>“He has hu-hu-hu-holes in his bat!” came from
Gamp. “Don’t be afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Put ’em right over,” urged Frank.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole team was talking to Dick, and the
boy needed it, for he felt himself quivering all over.
In vain he had tried to fling aside that shaking feeling,
but it clung to him most persistently. Somehow, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
heart was not in the game, and he felt that he was going
to be batted hard.</p>

<p>The next ball was wild, and the umpire called a
ball. Then Dick tried a high one, which Packard let
pass.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get it down, me bhoy,” said Barney
Mulloy.</p>

<p>Dick sent in a swift in shoot, and Packard fanned
again.</p>

<p>“That is doing pretty well!” roared the Yale crowd,
while Inza Burrage clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“Let him hit it!” urged Frank. “He won’t do any
damage.”</p>

<p>“Put it right over the pan,” came from Ready.</p>

<p>“Ram it over the slubber&mdash;I mean slam it over the
rubber!” Rattleton cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, put it over,” muttered Packard.</p>

<p>Dick did not intend to put the next one right over,
but he made a miscalculation and did so.</p>

<p>Packard hit it, driving out a clean single between
first and second.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” shouted the man with the dog.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked the dog.</p>

<p>Something seemed to smite Dick’s heart like a blow.
A haze rose before his eyes, across which he brushed
his hand. He thought of the peace and quietude of
Pleasant Valley, far away, with the mighty mountains
heaped against the sky, and he longed for the sound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
of the wind through the trees and the gentle murmur
of Felicia’s voice. With this feeling upon him, he was
tempted to walk off the diamond and refuse to pitch
another ball.</p>

<p>That was not all, for something within him seemed
crying:</p>

<p>“I hate baseball&mdash;I hate it!”</p>

<p>The ball was thrown in to him, but he did not see
it, and it bounded past.</p>

<p>Fortunately Hodge was watching and got the ball
at once, preventing Packard from taking second on
the throw.</p>

<p>“All right, Dick,” said Bart, as he tossed the ball
to the boy. “Don’t let that jar you. They can’t do a
thing with you.”</p>

<p>Bart had confidence in the lad, built of observation.
At first he had fancied it folly when Frank wished to
pitch Dick in an important game, but the work of the
clever youngster had gradually won Hodge. Still,
Bart considered Frank far superior to any pitcher, and
it was Merry he wished to see in the box.</p>

<p>Dick took the ball and stood facing Mason, the next
batter. These fellows were Frank’s college mates and
friends, and something told Dick that they could bat
against him with confidence.</p>

<p>“What’s the use to play ball?” flashed through the
brain of the boy. “If I couldn’t play at all would
Frank care so much about me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“Make him pitch, make him pitch!” cried Morgan.</p>

<p>“The batter is ready,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Still Dick stood there like one dazed.</p>

<p>“One ball!” exclaimed the umpire, making the decision
as a penalty for the delay.</p>

<p>“All right, Dick&mdash;all right,” said the calm voice of
Frank. “Don’t mind anything. Drop one over the
rubber.”</p>

<p>The word “drop” was a signal, giving Dick the cue
that Mason could not hit a drop ball very well. The
boy started, looked at Hodge, nodded, and swung his
arm.</p>

<p>Packard had obtained a good lead off first, and he
scooted for second.</p>

<p>Bart gathered himself, and Mason swung his bat
to bother the catcher, Hodge, however, was not at all
disturbed by the bat, and he sent the ball down with a
snapping short-arm throw.</p>

<p>“Slide!” shrieked the coacher.</p>

<p>Packard slid, Rattleton took the ball, and put it onto
him hard.</p>

<p>“Out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The crowd shouted.</p>

<p>“You should know better than to try that with
Hodge behind the plate, Packard!” yelled a Yale man.
“Haven’t you seen him throw enough to find out you
can’t steal on him?”</p>

<p>Packard walked off with his head down. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
fancied his lead off first was enough to let him down
to second safely.</p>

<p>One strike had been called on Mason.</p>

<p>Frank saw that Dick was unsteady, but he fancied
the putting out of Packard might brace him up. This
did not seem to be the result, for the boy put the next
one straight over and Mason smashed it hard.</p>

<p>Gamp made a great run for it but could not get
under the ball. Mason went over first at his best speed
and turned for second, being told to go along by the
coacher.</p>

<p>Gamp got the ball and lined it in to second, but Hock
was there safely, having made a clean two-bagger.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think about it now?” cried the
sporting man with the dog. “Everybody hits him
hard! He won’t last an inning!”</p>

<p>Starbright stepped out to the plate.</p>

<p>“High and close, Dick,” said Frank, in a low tone,
having run in till he was near his brother.</p>

<p>Starbright’s weak point was a high in shoot, which
was known very well to Frank.</p>

<p>Dick nodded in a mechanical manner, and then proceeded
to send over one that was just waist-high.</p>

<p>Starbright smashed it. The ball went straight at
Rattleton with fearful velocity. Harry stood up to it,
but it struck in his hands and dropped out.</p>

<p>A shout went up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>Harry, however, recovered quickly, got the ball, and
threw to Browning, who held it just in time.</p>

<p>“Out at first!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>“Dead lucky!” exclaimed the man with the dog.
“If it had gone through him, then the chap on second
would have scored. Oh, they will pound that kid to
death!”</p>

<p>“I hope they won’t!” breathed Elsie, “but I’m
afraid they will.”</p>

<p>“I’m not!” came from Inza. “Frank knows what to
do, and his brother must be all right, else he wouldn’t
let him pitch.”</p>

<p>“But see how hard they have hit.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t scored yet.”</p>

<p>Mulloy was the next hitter, and Merriwell knew he
was a bad man for any pitcher to face, therefore he
called to Dick and gave a sign for an out drop, as
that was Barney’s one weak point.</p>

<p>The heart of the boy had jumped into his throat
when Starbright hit the ball, but it fell back, and a
feeling of relief came over him as Rattleton saved
himself on the play. Dick nodded to Frank, but shook
his head when Bart called for an in shoot. Hodge
changed the sign and Dick nodded.</p>

<p>The boy started the ball straight at Barney, who
drew back a little and then swung poorly, as he saw
it was an out curve, succeeding in fouling the ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“One strike,” said the umpire, as they were playing
under National League rules.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Richard!” chirped Ready. “You’ve
got him down pat.”</p>

<p>“Pat is not me name,” said Barney.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be Dennis in a minute,” chuckled
Ready.</p>

<p>The next ball was high, and Barney came near going
after it, but held back just in time.</p>

<p>Another out drop was tried. This time, however,
Mulloy saw it must curve beyond the plate and refrained
from swinging.</p>

<p>The second ball was called. Dick tried one on the
inside corner, but the umpire refused to give it.</p>

<p>“Now he must put it over!” shouted Packard, who
was coaching.</p>

<p>Dick grew nervous, and failed to find the plate,
which gave the Irish youth a pass to first.</p>

<p>Gallup strode out to the plate, a grin on his homely
face.</p>

<p>“Gosh-darn if I ain’t glad I left the farm!” he said.
“Put the ball over the old dishpan an’ I’ll wallop it.”</p>

<p>Dick looked toward Merry, but, knowing Gallup
had no real weak point, Frank hesitated. Then he
gave a sign for the boy to use the jump ball.</p>

<p>Dick’s delivery was short and sharp, and he sent
the next one in with great speed. Gallup fancied it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
was coming about shoulder-high, which led him to
swing to meet it.</p>

<p>The ball took an awful jump, such as not even
Hodge was prepared for, struck the end of Bart’s mitt,
and went past.</p>

<p>The runners merrily moved up a bag each.</p>

<p>Hodge was angry with himself, for he realized
this was not Dick’s fault.</p>

<p>Again the boy grew nervous, for now there were
two coachers jabbering away, and a hit meant a score&mdash;perhaps
two.</p>

<p>With great deliberation Dick put the ball straight
over the plate, whereupon Gallup drove it hard and
far into right field.</p>

<p>The coachers sent both runners, seeing at a glance
that Carson had little show of getting the drive before
it struck the ground.</p>

<p>Berlin picked it up clean on the bound and threw
to second, stopping Gallup from going down, but both
Mason and Mulloy came home, giving the Mysteries
two runs.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind that, Dick,” said Frank, seeing that
there was a strained look on the face of his brother.
“Two scores can’t win this game. We’ll hold ’em now.”</p>

<p>The man with the big dog laughed his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Take the boy out!” cried several voices. “Take
him out! Take him out! Give us a pitcher! What did
we pay our money for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>Such cries might have dispirited a less determined
lad, but not so Dick Merriwell. There was something
in the sound that caused the lad’s teeth to clench like a
vise, while his eyes glittered with an inward fire and
he stiffened up. Not a word did he say, but into his
heart leaped a sudden mad resolve to show them what
he could do. Opposition and ridicule did not unman
him; instead, it put him on his mettle.</p>

<p>Dismal Jones walked out with his club, sadly saying:</p>

<p>“It’s too bad! I hate to do it.”</p>

<p>Dick began with the jump ball, and Hodge took
care to get up for it. Jones struck at least a foot under
the first one.</p>

<p>Bart called for a drop, but Dick shook his head and
gave the batter another exactly like the first.</p>

<p>Again the ball rose above Jones’ bat, and the second
strike was called.</p>

<p>“That’s pitching, Dick!” came the encouraging
voice of Frank. “You can keep it up.”</p>

<p>Now Dick had decided to use a drop next time, but
the word “up” from Frank was a signal for him to
continue with the high ball, which he did.</p>

<p>The third jump fooled Dismal just as the others
had, and he fanned out, the sphere plunking into Bart’s
big mitt and remaining there.</p>

<p>The third man was out.</p>

<span class="fs70">DICK SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Yale men gave a cheer, ending with the name
of Dick Merriwell, while Elsie and Inza flaunted their
flags.</p>

<p>“An accident,” sneered the man with the dog. “It
won’t happen again.”</p>

<p>Dick looked angry as he came walking in to the
bench, where Old Joe calmly smoked away.</p>

<p>“A little hard luck, that’s all,” said Hodge. “Don’t
mind it, Dick.”</p>

<p>“No hard luck about it!” flashed Dick. “It was my
wretched work that gave them their runs!”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Crowfoot. “Um ball-players hit
Injun Heart heap cracko. No let um do so some
more.”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry over it a bit,” smiled Frank. “I’ve
been hit lots harder than that in my day, and won my
game, too. There’s nothing serious about it yet.”</p>

<p>But Dick was wholly displeased with himself, and
he showed it in his angry manner.</p>

<p>Ready chose a bat and ambled out to the plate,
chirping:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>“It’s your funeral now, Morgan. Oh, Dadie, my
boy, we won’t do a single thing to you!”</p>

<p>Dade smiled in his sweetest manner. He was a
handsome fellow, and he made a graceful appearance
in his suit. He looked around to make sure every
man was in position.</p>

<p>Then Morgan broke loose and sent over a ball that
whistled through the air. His speed was something
surprising, even to those who knew him well.</p>

<p>“Strike!” called the umpire, although Jack had not
swung.</p>

<p>“La! la! what steam!” Ready exclaimed. “You
must have gunpowder in your wing, Dadie!”</p>

<p>Morgan’s next one was a beautiful in shoot, and,
thinking it another straight, swift one, Ready fanned.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>“There is a pitcher for you!” exclaimed the man
with the dog. “He’ll make that Merriwell aggregation
look like twenty-nine cents.”</p>

<p>“How the wind blows!” came from Ready. “That
nearly trimmed my whiskers.”</p>

<p>Morgan used the same delivery on the next ball, but
it proved to be a sharp drop, and Ready did not come
within a foot of it.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” rang the clear voice of the umpire.</p>

<p>The general crowd shouted with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Dade,” said Ready, “you’re a lucky dog. I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
decided to make a home run at the very start, but I
changed my mind. That’s what saved you.”</p>

<p>Again Morgan smiled. He knew Carson well, and
he started with a high in shoot, at which Berlin fanned.
Then followed a high one, which pulled the youth from
Colorado, and the second strike was called.</p>

<p>Having this advantage, Morgan deliberately wasted
two balls.</p>

<p>Carson waited for a good one, which he fancied he
had finally found. He hit the ball hard on the ground,
and it went straight at Mason. Just as it reached
Hock it took a bad bound, and Mason did not get his
hands on it fairly.</p>

<p>Carson was sprinting to first with all the speed he
could muster, which led Mason to snatch up the ball
and throw quicker than he had intended.</p>

<p>The throw was high for even tall Dick Starbright to
reach, and Berlin continued on to second, which he
safely reached.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” cried Ready, as he capered down
toward third. “You’ll have to get a step-ladder, Starbright,
old boy. The gentleman from South Carolina
is wilder than mountain scenery.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind that, Hock,” said Morgan, who was
captain of the team. “Get it down next time.”</p>

<p>Mason took such things hard, and Morgan knew it
would not do to “jump on him.”</p>

<p>Hodge walked out, his lips pressed together. Mor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>gan
realized that he was facing one of the hardest
batters on Merriwell’s team, and he at once resorted
to all the strategy he could command.</p>

<p>Hodge was anxious to hit, but he waited till two
balls were called. Then Dade put over a high straight
one, and Hodge smashed it.</p>

<p>The ball went along the ground to Packard, who
got in front of it and gathered it up. It was too late
to stop Carson from reaching third, but Oliver easily
threw Hodge out at first.</p>

<p>“Now a Texas leaguer!” cried Ready, as Browning
came up. “Move the outfielders back.”</p>

<p>Browning longed to smash the ball, but, to his dismay,
Merriwell gave him the sign to bunt. Carson
saw the sign also and knew what to do.</p>

<p>The first ball was shoulder-high, and high balls are
hard to bunt successfully, so Bruce let it pass.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Carson had played down on the pitch, but he went
back to third in a lively manner.</p>

<p>The next ball was too wide, and the umpire called
it a ball. Then came one that suited Bruce, who did
his best to drop it inside the line toward third.</p>

<p>To Browning’s astonishment, the bunt was almost
perfect. Bruce did not start quickly, however, and
Morgan came in for the ball like a leaping panther.</p>

<p>Carson tore down the line to the plate, and Dade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
realized that the only way to stop the score was to
throw Browning out at first.</p>

<p>Morgan gathered the ball and threw hastily. It
happened that Browning was between Dade and Starbright,
so that Morgan did not make a good throw.
Starbright stopped the ball with his big mitt, but it
dropped to the ground, and he could not get it up before
Browning went over the sack.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from the Yale men on the bleachers.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s hard luck!” exclaimed the fellow with
the dog. “They got that run without making a hit
off Morgan.”</p>

<p>This was true.</p>

<p>The smile had vanished from Dade’s face as he
returned to the pitcher’s position. Gamp was up, and
Morgan again burned the ball over with great speed.
He was seeking to strike Gamp out, and he failed to
hold Browning close to first, thinking Bruce too slow
and lazy to steal.</p>

<p>But, when thoroughly awakened, Browning was
anything but slow. He started for second on the second
ball pitched, and seemed to gather momentum with
every stride.</p>

<p>Mulloy lined the ball down, the throw being a trifle
high. However, it seemed that Packard would get it
in time. Browning slid feet first for the bag.</p>

<p>Packard was not anxious to get in the way of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
big fellow’s spikes, and he failed to get the ball onto
Bruce quite soon enough.</p>

<p>“Safe!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” cried the man with the dog. “He was
out! Shoot the umpire!”</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h, go choke yourself!” cried several of the
Yale men.</p>

<p>One strike and one ball had been called. Dade gave
Gamp a drop, and Joe met it. The ball sailed away
into deep center, while Browning sprinted to bring in
the score that would tie.</p>

<p>Ephraim Gallup made his long legs fly in his run to
get under the ball. It did not seem that he could reach
it by many feet, but he hurled himself forward in a
last furious effort, and got his hands on it. Then he
went whirling end over end and held fast to the ball
till he could rise and hold it up.</p>

<p>“Out!” was the decision of the umpire.</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h!” shouted the man with the dog. “Even
that wasn’t a hit! Now they’ll get after the boy!”</p>

<p>The crowd applauded Gallup’s remarkable catch,
even Inza Burrage being led to clap her hands, although
she declared she was sorry he held the ball.</p>

<p>“Don’t know when I’ve worked as hard as that before,”
grumbled Browning, “and all for nothing. It
makes me very tired.”</p>

<p>“Heap good work now,” said Old Joe to Dick, as
the latter rose from the bench. “Joe, him lookin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>The boy said nothing, but there was determination
in his manner as he walked onto the diamond. For
the time he forgot his home far away under the shadow
of the eternal Rockies, he forgot Felicia and her
calling voice, and he thought of nothing save the game
in which he was taking part.</p>

<p>“They will bat him out of the box this inning,”
said the man with the dog.</p>

<p>“They will not!” murmured Inza firmly.</p>

<p>“I hope not!” whispered Elsie. “He is handsome!
Don’t you think he is, Inza?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but not as handsome as Frank.”</p>

<p>“He is much younger.”</p>

<p>“He never can be as handsome as Frank!” exclaimed
the loyal Inza.</p>

<p>“Somehow he reminds me of Bart,” said Elsie.
“He is dark, and there is something like Bart in his
manner.”</p>

<p>“I have noticed it.”</p>

<p>Dick warmed up by throwing a few to Browning on
first.</p>

<p>Gene Skelding, once the uncompromising enemy of
Frank Merriwell, was the first man to strike in this
inning. Skelding had changed and reformed, having
quit his former vicious associates, and he was proving
to be quite a decent fellow.</p>

<p>Skelding, however, was not a heavy hitter, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
Hodge knew it. Bart called for the jump ball at the
start, which Dick sent whistling over.</p>

<p>Skelding went after it.</p>

<p>“Strike!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>An out drop followed, and Gene fouled it.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>Then Dick sent in another rise. Gene fouled that,
but, as two strikes had been called, it did not count
against him.</p>

<p>Then came one over his head, which he let pass.</p>

<p>Bart signed for an out drop. It came up slowly
and looked pretty to Gene, but he missed it cleanly,
Hodge holding it.</p>

<p>“Batter is out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>A shout rose from the spectators.</p>

<p>“Pretty pitching!” cried Hodge approvingly.</p>

<p>Dick betrayed no sound of elation, nor did he notice
the shouting crowd.</p>

<p>Hans Dunnerwurst came toddling out with a bat.</p>

<p>“You vill had to put der plate righdt ofer der pall,
my poy,” he announced. “Der pad vons nefer hit at
me. I haf an eye like an eagles. Yaw!”</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to swipe at the very first one,
although it was so high that it seemed almost out of
reach.</p>

<p>“What in the world have they got that chump on
the team for?” angrily exclaimed the man with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
dog. “He couldn’t knock a corner off a house if somebody
threw it over the plate!”</p>

<p>“Here! here! what you doin’, Dutchy?” cried
Ephraim Gallup. “Why don’t you let that kind go,
you big, fat chump?”</p>

<p>“You vas a pig, vat chumps myseluf!” snorted Hans
angrily. “Don’d you shooted off your mouth some
more or I vill hit you in my eye! Dot’s vot vos der
madder mit Hannah!”</p>

<p>The next ball was so low that it almost hit the plate,
yet Hans seemed to shut his eyes and swipe at it wildly,
missing it by about two feet.</p>

<p>“Oh!” roared the crowd. “Where did he ever play
ball?”</p>

<p>“None uf my pusiness!” squawked Hans, apparently
very angry. “Shust you vait an hour und I vill knock
der pall off der cover!”</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell had been serious enough, but now
the comical Dutch youth proved too much for the boy,
and he broke into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” he laughed. “Oh, ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Maype you vill nod laugh so hardness britty quickness,”
said Hans hotly. “Shust you pay attendance
to my business und bitch der pall!”</p>

<p>Dick received the ball from Bart, but he could not
recover from his amusement at once, and Morgan
called for the umpire to make him pitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>Thinking the umpire might call a ball on him again
for delaying the game, Dick sent it over.</p>

<p>How it happened no one could tell, but Hans
slashed at it and hit it fairly, driving it over the infield
and away into the outfield.</p>

<p>“Yow!” whooped the Dutch boy, as he made his
short legs twinkle. “Didn’d you told me so! I
knewed vot der pall vould done to me!”</p>

<p>Packard saw there was a chance for Hans to reach
second, and so he sent him along. Never in all his
life had the Dutch youth run faster, and the sight was
a most ludicrous one.</p>

<p>Swiftwing overtook the ball and turned to throw it
to second. He was a good thrower, and he lined it
straight into the waiting hands of Rattleton.</p>

<p>Just before reaching second Hans seemed to trip
over his own feet, and down he went, turning over and
over on the ground, like a ball. When he stopped he
was sitting on second base, and he had reached it in
time to be safe.</p>

<p>How the crowd shouted.</p>

<p>“Dunnerwurst’s usual luck!” laughed Frank Merriwell.
“He can blunder into more things like that than
any fellow I ever saw play baseball.”</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell had not stopped laughing, for the
sight of Hans running like a frightened duck and turning
over and over to sit up on the bag was so comical
the boy found it impossible not to be amused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said the man with the dog, “that settles it!
When a fat slob like that can make a two-bagger off
Merriwell’s brother, everybody can hit him. Hey,
Nero?”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked the dog.</p>

<p>Dade Morgan was well satisfied, and he wore his
sweetest smile when he walked out to the plate. He
assumed an easy batting position, swinging handsomely
at the first one pitched, but failing to hit it.</p>

<p>“There’s a batter!” exclaimed the man with the dog.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell steadied down now, giving Morgan
the jump ball the next time, which caused Dade to
miss again.</p>

<p>Then Bart signed for a drop, but Dick shook his
head, having been given a tip from Frank. A high
in shoot drove Dade back from the plate, and an out
followed. Morgan hit the ball foul.</p>

<p>“You’ll lace it next trip, Dade!” cried Packard.</p>

<p>“Und I vill get indo a score,” declared Dunnerwurst.
“I vos a recular chain-lightnings running pases!”</p>

<p>Dick took the time limit on Morgan, and gave him
the jump ball once more. Morgan missed it.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>The man with the dog muttered something to himself,
while the Yale crowd cheered.</p>

<p>“Beautiful work, Dick!” exclaimed Frank. “Now
you are pitching your game!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>Packard ran in from the coach-line, and stepped out
with his special bat.</p>

<p>“Put it over good,” he invited. “I’ll hit it a mile.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the boy coolly. “Here you have
it.”</p>

<p>He threw the ball with a good rise on it, and Packard
hit it.</p>

<p>Up into the air the ball sailed. Dick stood in his
tracks.</p>

<p>“Take it, Dick!” cried Merry, as he ran in to back
the boy up.</p>

<p>Down came the ball, and it was gracefully captured
and held by the boy pitcher, which retired the side.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Frank Merriwell’s brother?”
shouted one of the Yale men.</p>

<p>“He’s all right!” roared all the others.</p>

<p>Then, as the cheering subsided, up from the bench
rose Old Joe Crowfoot, and from his lips pealed a
yell that was shrill and clear and piercing. It was his
tribute to the skill and prowess of his beloved <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span>.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="fs70 lsp">A MOMENT OF PERIL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The old Indian sat down and resumed smoking.</p>

<p>“Heap good!” he grunted, as Dick came in. “Make
um strikin’ man go swish-swish. ’Nother one send
um up easy ball, you ketch him slick. All right so! Injun
Heart heap get into gear.”</p>

<p>Old Joe was beginning to pick up current slang.</p>

<p>Inza Burrage was signaling from the bleachers, and
Frank started over at once.</p>

<p>“Bring your brother!” she exclaimed, as soon as
Merry was near. “I want to speak to him.”</p>

<p>So Frank went back for Dick, who came over
quietly.</p>

<p>Inza descended to the front of the bleachers, followed
by Elsie, who saw Bart approaching.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad to see you again, Frank!” exclaimed
the dark-eyed girl, her cheeks glowing, as she gave
him her hand.</p>

<p>“And I to see you, Inza!” he returned, giving her
hand a warm pressure and looking deep into her eyes.
“This is a great surprise. I did not think of seeing
you here. You must have had it nicely arranged.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t we?” she exclaimed. “And this is your
brother? He is splendid, Frank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>Merry introduced Dick, who lifted his cap, smiled
into Inza’s dark eyes, and gave her his hand. At the
touch of their hands it seemed as if a bond of sympathy
was established between them.</p>

<p>In the meantime Bart was speaking with Elsie, who
betrayed her happiness in her voice and manner. Up
on the bleachers a man was talking to a big dog.</p>

<p>“Sec him, Nero!” said the man, pointing to Dick.
“Look at him, boy! That’s the one.”</p>

<p>The dog growled.</p>

<p>“Ha!” muttered the man. “Now you’ve got your
eye on him!”</p>

<p>Again a growl.</p>

<p>“He’s a tramp,” said the man. “A tramp, Nero.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>The dog growled fiercely and seemed eager to break
away, but his master restrained him.</p>

<p>“Not now, boy,” he said. “Wait. He doesn’t
look like a tramp, but he is. You know what to do to
tramps, don’t you, boy?”</p>

<p>The animal showed his teeth in something like a
snarl.</p>

<p>“Steady! Hold your temper now, Nero, but watch
him&mdash;watch him! That’s all.”</p>

<p>By this time it was necessary for the three players
to hurry back to the bench, as John Swiftwing already
had two strikes called against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>The dog strained and started when Dick walked
away, but the man held him in restraint.</p>

<p>Swiftwing finally hit the ball, but it went into the
hands of Skelding, who made a pretty throw to first,
and the young Indian was out.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell was the next batter. He had a
favorite bat, but, by some mischance, it was not in the
pile, and he was compelled to take another stick.</p>

<p>Morgan smiled as Merry came up.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit it too hard,” he said. “Be satisfied with
a two-bagger.”</p>

<p>Merry did not retort, but merely smiled a bit. Dade
started with a high one, but Frank did not bite, and a
ball was called. Then came an out drop that was wide
of the plate. It was another ball.</p>

<p>Dade followed with a straight drop, which Merry
let pass, but the umpire called a strike. An in shoot
forced Frank back.</p>

<p>“Three balls!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Got him in a hole!” cried Ready. “He can’t put it
over, Merry.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Dade did not wish to put it over, for the
following pitch was a bad one, and Frank was sent to
first on four balls.</p>

<p>Rattleton was the batter to follow, a fact known to
Morgan. Harry was not a sure hitter, but he was one
who hit at the most unexpected times. Morgan knew
him pretty well, and he proceeded to work him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>Frank signed that he would go down on the second
ball, and Harry slashed at it, though it was a bad one.</p>

<p>Merry showed what fast base-running was then,
as he was forced to do his best and slide at the finish.
He came up to the bag in handsome style, a moment
before Packard could touch him with the ball.</p>

<p>“How easy&mdash;oh, how easy!” sang Ready. “Don’t
you like the way he does it? Isn’t he a peach?”</p>

<p>It was a lucky thing that Merry stole the base, for
Rattleton hit weakly to Morgan, who could have made
it a double play had there been a chance. Rattleton
was thrown out at first. Two men were out, and Dick
Merriwell was the hitter.</p>

<p>“Fan him, Dade!” urged Mason.</p>

<p>Morgan fancied the task would be simple, and he
sent in the ball with plenty of speed.</p>

<p>Mulloy dropped the first one, permitting it to roll
away from him to the right. Frank seized the opportunity
to go to third. Barney leaped after the ball,
got it, and threw to third, but again Frank made a
handsome slide and was safe.</p>

<p>This was fast base-running, and it set the spectators
to cheering loudly. The Yale crowd broke into a
cheer in unison, while Inza and Elsie waved their banners.</p>

<p>Dick set his teeth. He had struck at the first one,
but he realized he was not swift enough, the ball having
passed before he swung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>Morgan did not feel at all worried, for he fancied
Dick would be an easy out. The boy realized that he
would not be able to swing hard at the ball and hit it,
on account of Morgan’s great speed, so he gripped his
bat firmly and gave it a short, sharp jerk when the
next ball was pitched.</p>

<p>It did not seem that he struck hard enough to kill
a fly, but the ball went off the bat on a line, and was
a clean hit over the infield, bringing Frank home.</p>

<p>Morgan was angry, and he could not help showing
it. When the ball came in to him, he threw it down at
his feet and walked round the pitcher’s plate. The
ball rolled a short distance away, and then there was
a shout.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell had seized the opportunity to try
for second.</p>

<p>Morgan leaped for the ball, got it, whirled, sent it
to Packard. It was a bad throw, and the ball went
far out into the field.</p>

<p>Dick did not stop, but kept straight on for third,
running as fast as he could, which was like a young
deer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the ball went straight to Gallup, who
picked it up cleanly and threw to third. Gallup was
a phenomenal thrower, and the ball sailed to third on
a line.</p>

<p>Skelding took it just as Dick went forward in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
headlong slide. Even then the boy slid round Gene,
and to many it seemed that he was safe, but the umpire
cried:</p>

<p>“Out at third!”</p>

<p>Frank made a protest, but the decision stood, and
that made the third man out. The score was tied,
however.</p>

<p>It seemed that Dick was winded after that hard run,
and it was necessary for him to go into the box and
begin pitching at once.</p>

<p>“Now they’ll pound him out!” exclaimed the man
with the dog. “See if they don’t!”</p>

<p>Dick, however, was scarcely breathing harder than
usual. His training had made him hard as iron, and
he could stand the strain of severe and sudden exertion
without showing it.</p>

<p>Hodge knew his business pretty well, and he found
difficulty in adjusting the body-protector, which made
time for Dick to fully recover, in case he needed it.</p>

<p>The best batters of the Mysteries were up against
the boy, Mason leading off. The young pitcher sent
the first ball over with a jump, and Mason missed it.</p>

<p>“One strike!”</p>

<p>Then followed a high in shoot, but Hock had his
eyes open, and let it pass. The third one was too high,
which made the second ball.</p>

<p>It seemed that Dick followed this with another high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
one, but the ball took a sharp drop and fell across the
shoulders of the batter.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>Immediately Mason objected, but the umpire silenced
him instantly. Still keeping the ball high, the
boy used an in shoot, but it was not over.</p>

<p>“Three balls!”</p>

<p>“He’s got to put it over!” exclaimed the man with
the dog.</p>

<p>Dick did put it over, but the jump on the ball was
too much for the calculation of Mason, who missed
it again and was out.</p>

<p>“That looks like batting him out of the box!” cried
one of the Yale men.</p>

<p>There was not a word from the man with the dog.</p>

<p>Dick knew well enough that Starbright must be a
hitter, although the big Yale man had not hit safely
the first time up.</p>

<p>Again Frank gave the boy a sign, and again Dick
worked the batter carefully and in a heady manner,
at last forcing him to hit a weak one down to first.
Browning got the ball and easily reached the base
ahead of the runner.</p>

<p>Two men were out, and the Yale crowd broke loose
in a joyous manner.</p>

<p>Mulloy felt that it was necessary for him to do
something, and yet he declined to be pulled by a wide
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“No ye don’t, me bhoy!” muttered the Irish youth.
“Get ’em over av ye ixpict me to swing.”</p>

<p>Dick did put one over, but it looked high, and came
down with a sharp drop.</p>

<p>Barney was deceived, and he growled when the umpire
called a strike on him. Following this, Dick used
a swift, high, straight one, and Mulloy hit it, although
it would have been a ball had he let it pass.</p>

<p>It was a clean hit past second. Gamp fielded it in
to second in a hurry, preventing Barney from getting
two bases.</p>

<p>“Now it starts!” muttered the man with the dog.</p>

<p>Gallup walked out in an awkward manner. He had
hit the ball hard before, and he felt confident of doing
so again. But the boy used the jump ball to start
with, and Ephraim was surprised when he failed to
hit anything more solid than the empty air.</p>

<p>Then Dick wasted a ball in trying to “pull” the batter,
but sent the next one over the inside corner.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” cried Jack Ready. “You can’t hit
him, Gallup, and you may as well go back to the
farm.”</p>

<p>Dick took his time about pitching the ball again.
He was on the verge of making the delivery when
there came a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>Across the field a big dog was rushing straight at
the boy pitcher, his eyes gleaming, and his mouth open.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
Dick turned and saw the dog coming. For a moment
he stood there, evidently wondering if the animal was
coming at him, and then he drew back the hand that
held the ball.</p>

<p>“Look out!” roared the voices of men, as they rose
to their feet in the grand stand and on the bleachers.
“The dog is mad!”</p>

<p>Then Dick threw the ball, swift as a bullet, straight
into the open mouth of the dog.</p>

<p>The creature had been on the verge of leaping at the
throat of the boy, but the speed of the ball checked him
somewhat.</p>

<p>The ball seemed to become wedged in the dog’s
jaws, and Dick easily stepped aside and avoided the
creature.</p>

<p>Onto the diamond came Old Joe Crowfoot. Like a
leaping panther he went at the dog, flung himself on
the animal, and grasped it by the neck.</p>

<p>Old Joe’s hand rose with something bright in it. It
fell with a swift movement, and a long knife was
buried to the hilt in the side of the dog.</p>

<p>Old Joe did not need to strike again, for his eye had
been accurate and his stroke sure. Pierced to the heart
by the keen knife, the dog was flung aside by the Indian
to fall in its death throes on the dirt of the diamond.</p>

<p>Crowfoot calmly wiped the blood-stained knife on
his buckskin trousers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>The excitement was great at that moment. A number
of the players, armed with bats, rushed out; but
their aid was not needed, for the dog was dying.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Old Joe. “Heap ugly dog! Him
want to bite somebody. No want to bite some more.”</p>

<p>A man came rushing across from the bleachers. It
was the dog’s master, and he was furious in his rage.</p>

<p>“That dog was worth five hundred dollars!” he
snarled. “I’ll shoot the old skunk who killed him!”</p>

<p>He pulled a revolver and tried to get at Old Joe,
who watched him quietly, seeming not at all alarmed.</p>

<p>Two policemen hurried up.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell had placed himself between the
owner of the dead dog and Crowfoot.</p>

<p>“Put up that pistol!” commanded Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot him!” raged the man. “He has killed
Nero!”</p>

<p>Then he saw the policemen hurrying forward, and
he suddenly decided to put the revolver away; but he
called to the officers and demanded that the slayer of
the dog be arrested.</p>

<p>“He carries concealed weapons!” declared the man.</p>

<p>“Better drop that,” spoke Frank, in a low tone.
“You have a revolver on your person, and I shall make
a charge against you if you kick up trouble.”</p>

<p>“The dog must have been mad,” said one of the
policemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“Of course he was,” exclaimed several of the players.
“It’s great luck he didn’t get at the boy.”</p>

<p>“Methinks Joseph Crowfoot, Esquire, is deserving
of a gold medal,” said Jack Ready. “He is a very
handy old gentleman with a carver.”</p>

<p>“But he has no right to carry concealed weapons,”
said one of the officers. “We shall have to arrest
him.”</p>

<p>“Even so, and I will cheerfully pay his fine,” came
from Ready.</p>

<p>“But first make sure he has concealed weapons on
his person,” said Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>“He had a knife.”</p>

<p>“It was in his hand when he went after the dog.”</p>

<p>“He must have it about him now.”</p>

<p>“It is easy enough to decide that point. Search
him.”</p>

<p>Old Joe was standing with his arms folded on his
breast, apparently not at all concerned by the hubbub.</p>

<p>One of the officers advanced and grasped him by the
shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>“Hand over that knife!”</p>

<p>“No got knife,” was the scornful answer.</p>

<p>“Hand it over!” sharply and threateningly commanded
the policeman.</p>

<p>“No got knife,” repeated the redskin.</p>

<p>“Don’t lie! I saw you have it.”</p>

<p>“No got it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“If you don’t hand it over, I shall search you.”</p>

<p>Joe stood straight as a mountain pine, his beady
black eyes full of defiance.</p>

<p>“Not got it,” was his reiteration.</p>

<p>“Come,” growled the officer. “I’ll take you up here
and search you.”</p>

<p>The Indian did not object, but, when he was taken
into a room beneath the grand stand and searched, the
knife was not found upon him.</p>

<p>“What have you done with it?” demanded the puzzled
and angry policeman.</p>

<p>“No got it,” was all he could force Joe to say in
answer.</p>

<p>“But you had it.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the redskin.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell came to Joe’s relief.</p>

<p>“You have found no concealed weapon on him,
officer,” said Merry. “Won’t it be best to let him go?
You know he did a good job, and saved somebody
from getting hurt by that dog.”</p>

<p>“What is he traveling round here for, anyhow?”
asked the cop, unable to recover from his anger.</p>

<p>“He is the mascot of our team,” Merry exclaimed.
“He is also a friend to my brother.”</p>

<p>“But he has no right in a civilized country. I ought
to run him in and see that he’s properly cared for.”</p>

<p>“I will see that he is properly cared for, Mr. Officer.
Leave him to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>“What if the owner of the dog makes a complaint
against him?”</p>

<p>“He won’t.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because he hasn’t, and he knows he will get into
trouble if he does.”</p>

<p>Frank had hit the nail on the head. The owner of
the dog realized he had been heard when he pointed
out Dick Merriwell to the huge animal, and he was
afraid to carry the matter too far. Although furious
at the death of the dog, he soon decided to withdraw
and keep still, for the time, at least.</p>

<p>Frank talked privately to the officer for a few moments,
promising Crowfoot should face any complaint
made, and the policeman decided not to arrest the old
Indian then.</p>

<p>The umpire had called time as soon as he could,
and the game was not resumed until Merriwell and
Old Joe appeared, followed by the policeman, and
walked out to the bench, where the Indian sat down.</p>

<p>Then the crowd cheered for the aged Indian, but
he seemed not to hear their shouting. With perfect
nonchalance he proceeded to refill and relight his pipe.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<span class="fs70 lsp">GETTING THE LEAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Berlin Carson had been quick-witted enough to get
the knife away from Crowfoot, aided by Dick Merriwell,
who was able to make the Indian understand he
was in danger if the weapon was found upon his
person.</p>

<p>Frank’s eyes detected this move, and so he did not
worry much when the redskin was searched for concealed
weapons.</p>

<p>Dick’s nerve seemed unshaken, as he again walked
on the field to resume pitching. The Yale men broke
into wild cheering for the boy, which was taken up
all around the field.</p>

<p>“That’s ernough to make a feller strike out,” said
Gallup.</p>

<p>Instead of striking out, however, he put up an easy
fly that was gathered in by Browning.</p>

<p>The owner of the dog did not return to the vicinity
of the Yale crowd on the bleachers. He had lost his
money, and he did not wish to give the winners a
chance to laugh at him.</p>

<p>In this inning Dick Merriwell had proved himself a
marvel for a boy of his years; but the game was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
young, and Morgan’s team felt confident of falling on
the lad before long and striking a winning streak.</p>

<p>Morgan was on his mettle when he again walked
out to pitch.</p>

<p>“I must win this game!” he mentally exclaimed.
“It will be awful to lose the game, with a boy like
that pitching against me!”</p>

<p>With the head of the batting-list up, it looked as if
there was something doing for the Merries. It looked
more so when Ready reached first on a safe hit, and
Morgan set his teeth.</p>

<p>Carson did not attempt to sacrifice, Merriwell having
given the “hit and run” signal. He drove the ball
hotly along the ground between Skelding and Mason.
Gene got his hand on the ball, but it carromed off.
Fortunately for him, it went straight into the hands of
Mason, who picked it up and threw like a flash to
second.</p>

<p>The ball reached Packard before Ready got down,
and he lined it to first, completing a pretty double play.</p>

<p>“Now ye’re playing ball, me bhoys!” cried Barney
Mulloy, in deep satisfaction. “Kape it up! Kape it
up!”</p>

<p>Morgan smiled again when Bart Hodge faced him.
It seemed that his temper had been restored, and he
was perfectly confident. He used his head in working
Hodge, but found Bart a fine waiter. With two
strikes and three balls called, Bart declined to swing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
on the next pitch, though to many the ball looked
good.</p>

<p>“Take your base,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Hodge wore a grim smile as he trotted down to first.
Then he got a fair lead, and went for second on the
first ball pitched. Mulloy threw, but Hodge sprinted
like the wind, and slid under safely.</p>

<p>“That’s playing ball!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>Hodge was a great worker, and he never quit, no
matter how poor the prospect. But all were surprised
when Bart went to third on a “dope ball” sent in by
Morgan to Browning. The ball hung in the air, and,
having a lead on it, Bart set his teeth and fairly flew
along the line.</p>

<p>Mulloy threw as soon as he could when the ball
reached him, but the runner went round behind Skelding
and was safe.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said a Yale man, rising amid the
group on the bleachers, “you see the kind of a man we
lost when that fellow got his sheepskin! He is in
every respect a jim-dandy!”</p>

<p>Somehow the success of Hodge seemed to rattle
Morgan, for he followed with a wild pitch, and Bart
came scampering home with the run that put the Merries
in the lead.</p>

<p>But Morgan settled down after that, and proceeded
to strike Browning out.</p>

<p>“Now hold ’em, boys!” cried Ready, waltzing down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
to third. “We must show these fresh chaps that they
are not in the same class as our great and mighty aggregation.”</p>

<p>Dismal Jones really tried to smile when he walked
out with a bat, but the effort seemed to cause him
pain, and it was very distressing in its effect.</p>

<p>Dick found that Jones was determined to make him
put the ball over, and he finally did so, which gave
Dismal the opportunity he wanted. It was a gentle
little hit, but the ball dropped beyond the infield, and
Jones landed on first base.</p>

<p>It is possible that Dick regarded Skelding as too
easy, but Gene did not hit the ball fair and hard. It
went down to Ready on a slow bound, and Jack
stopped it awkwardly, letting it get out of his hands.
When he picked it up to throw it was too late to make
a double play, and Skelding was well down toward
first.</p>

<p>Jack would have sent the ball across, but, fearing
for a wild throw, Merry shouted for him to hold it.
Ready had made the first error for the Merries.</p>

<p>But now came Hans Dunnerwurst.</p>

<p>“Mofe your fielders avay off nearer!” he cried, with
a wave of his short arm. “I vos goin’ to knock der
pall der elefated railroadt ofer alretty soon.”</p>

<p>Dick remembered that the Dutch youth had secured
a most unexpected two-bagger the first time up, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
this put the lad at his best. He used his best speed and
a jump ball till two strikes were called; then he resorted
to a drop.</p>

<p>Dunnerwurst hit the ball straight to Ready, and hit
it hard. It went on a line. Jack froze to it, held it,
and threw to second.</p>

<p>Both runners had started when the ball was hit, and
Jones had not even stopped running for third when the
ball whistled past his head on its way to second.</p>

<p>Rattleton was wide-awake, and he covered the bag,
taking the throw and whirling to first.</p>

<p>Skelding had stopped and was trying to dig back
to first.</p>

<p>Harry shot the ball into Browning’s hands, thus
completing a beautiful triple play.</p>

<p>How the crowd roared! This was ball-playing to
satisfy the most exacting fan.</p>

<p>Hans Dunnerwurst stood with his mouth open, staring
blankly.</p>

<p>“Vot vos der madder?” he muttered. “I pelief
somebody vos oudt alretty!”</p>

<p>But it seemed to take him several seconds to understand
that the side had been retired.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that beautiful, Elsie?” cried Inza. “Did
you ever see anything so fine before?”</p>

<p>Elsie laughed and gave Inza’s arm a squeeze.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I saw something just as fine when
Bart stole those two bases, one after another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>“It’s Bart, Bart, all the time!” laughed the dark-eyed
girl. “Do you never think of any one but Bart?”</p>

<p>“Hardly ever,” confessed Elsie, blushing.</p>

<p>“Let me git holt of a bub-bub-bub-bat!” exclaimed
Joe Gamp, as he strode in to the bench. “Danged if
I have made a hit to-day! It’s tut-tut-tut-time I did
something.”</p>

<p>Morgan’s courage was good when he went into the
box, and he did not let up a bit. His speed remained
great, and Gamp threatened to strike out quickly.
However, Joe bumped the ball at last, though it went
to Dade on the bound, and he threw Joe out at first.</p>

<p>“That’s a good start, old man!” came from Oliver
Packard. “Keep it up! We’ll get into the game and
win yet.”</p>

<p>Swiftwing hit the ball, but it sailed high into the
air. Mason got under it and held it safely when it
came down.</p>

<p>Morgan remembered what Merry had done the first
time, and this time he resolved to make Frank hit.
He put the ball over with great speed, getting two
strikes called. Then Merry placed a little single and
took first.</p>

<p>With Rattleton up, however, there seemed little
show. Harry looked at Frank, who gave him a signal
to wait.</p>

<p>Morgan had a way of working the corners, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
just now he could not seem to get the ball over, which
gave Rattleton a base on balls.</p>

<p>“We’ll score a few right now!” cried Ready. “Here
is the chap who can turn the trick. Remember what
he did to you last time, Dade.”</p>

<p>It was Dick Merriwell, and he received a round of
applause when he stepped out to strike. Dick had
plenty of courage, and he finally found one that suited
him, hitting it fairly. The ball went out on a line,
and the base-runners started instantly.</p>

<p>It looked like a clean hit, but Dismal Jones came
in on the jump and caught the ball within six inches
of the ground.</p>

<p>“Out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The side was retired.</p>

<p>“Almost good, Dick,” said Frank. “You bumped
it hard, boy.”</p>

<p>But Dick was not pleased, as he had fancied the hit
good.</p>

<p>Morgan faced Dick, who proceeded to strike Dade
out.</p>

<p>“Good start!” said Frank.</p>

<p>Packard drove a hot one at Frank, who gathered it
gracefully and whistled it across to Browning, putting
the second man out.</p>

<p>“One, two, three,” counted Ready. “Mason is the
next victim. Walk up and take your bitters, Hock.”</p>

<p>Mason frowned, for Ready’s airy manner always ir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>ritated
him. Then he hit the first ball pitched, putting
it into right field for one base.</p>

<p>“Good boy!” cried Ready. “But you’ll die there,
Hocksie.”</p>

<p>This prophecy proved true, Starbright sending out a
long fly that was captured by Gamp.</p>

<p>“Let’s quit fooling, fellows&mdash;let’s quit fooling,”
urged Ready. “We may as well clinch the game now
as any time. I’ll lead right off with a two-bagger.”</p>

<p>But his two-bagger proved simply a pretty fly into
the hands of Dismal Jones, who was as sure as grim
death in his fielding.</p>

<p>“Hard luck!” muttered Ready; “but it is also combined
with poor judgment in hitting. I am not such
a much. At least, I am beginning to fear so.”</p>

<p>Carson found one that suited him, and drove it far
into the field. However, Gamp returned it to second
in time to prevent him from taking more than one
base.</p>

<p>Ready started coaching near first. Carson played
off, fancying Morgan was on the point of delivering
the ball, and then Dade suddenly whirled and threw
to Starbright.</p>

<p>“Back!” yelled Ready.</p>

<p>Carson tried to get back. Swift as he was, however,
Starbright had the ball, and put it onto him.</p>

<p>“Out!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>“Will you please kick me?” exclaimed Ready. “I
did that by getting you off too far.”</p>

<p>To Hodge it seemed that his show was poor, as
there was no one ahead of him on bases when he came
up, and two were out. He remembered, however,
what he had done before, and he resolved to make another
attempt of the same sort.</p>

<p>With two out, Morgan ventured to put one right
over for Bart. Hodge hit it for a safe single.</p>

<p>“Well, here we go!” cried Ready. “He’ll make
another run without half-trying.”</p>

<p>But Morgan watched Bart so closely that the latter
could not steal second, as he had before. Then Browning
put up an infield fly, which was captured by Mason.</p>

<p>The sixth inning began with Mulloy at the bat.
Barney led off with a clean single. Dick permitted
the Irish youth to get too much of a start, and he stole
second, for all of Bart’s handsome throw to Rattleton.</p>

<p>Gallup struck hard at the first ball, but missed, as it
jumped. The next one failed to take the jump, although
Dick threw it for that kind of a ball, and
Ephraim smashed it.</p>

<p>Out on a line whistled the ball, going far into right
field, Carson chasing it. Mulloy came sprinting home,
while Ephraim went down to second. The throw to
second was not good, and Gallup kept on to third,
which he reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>The score was tied, and the Mysteries had a man on
third, with no one out.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that awful!” gasped Elsie Bellwood. “I’m
afraid they are going to lose the game! Why doesn’t
Frank go in and pitch now?”</p>

<p>“Frank will go if he thinks it necessary,” said Inza.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell was pale, but he did not seem at all
rattled. Jones stood up to the plate, and refused to
hit anything that was not fairly over. Dick tried to
work him too long, with the result that the umpire
sent the batter to first on balls.</p>

<p>Hodge threw the ball slowly to first. Something
unexpected happened. Quick as a flash, Gallup took
advantage of the slow throw to dash for home.</p>

<p>A shout went up. Ephraim flung himself forward
in a slide. Browning whistled the ball back to Bart,
who took it and swung to touch Gallup.</p>

<p>Ephraim was safe, and the Mysteries had taken the
lead. Still not a man was out.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell seemed dazed, which led Jones to
fancy he could steal second. He started before the boy
had made a motion to deliver the ball to the next batter,
and Dick suddenly whirled and threw to Rattleton.</p>

<p>Dismal was caught between the bases. For a moment
there was a little excitement as Jones tried to
dodge the ball and escape being tagged, but Dick ran
in, got the ball himself and chased the runner down.</p>

<p>Flushed but triumphant, Dick returned to the box.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
Skelding came to bat, and hit weakly to Frank, who
threw to Bruce, and the second man was out. Dunnerwurst
put up an easy fly to Rattleton.</p>

<p>“We must square this up in a hurry,” said Jack
Ready. “They had horseshoe luck to start with that
inning. It ended quickly enough when we got into
gear.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hazard came over and smiled on Frank.</p>

<p>“I rather think we have you, Mr. Merriwell,” he
said.</p>

<p>“There is another think due you, sir,” put in Ready.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Gramp was earnest'">Gamp was earnest</ins> to make a hit, but drove a
grounder to Mason, who threw handsomely to Starbright.</p>

<p>Swiftwing sent a long fly into the outfield, and
Jones muffed it, after a hard run.</p>

<p>Frank placed a hit in right field, sending the young
Indian round to third. Merry then signaled for Rattleton
to bunt the first ball.</p>

<p>Frank got a lead and started for second with the
swing of the pitcher’s arm.</p>

<p>Rattleton was not a scientific bunter, and he hit the
ball into the air. Morgan ran for it, got under it,
held it, and then threw to first, making a double play.</p>

<p>Thus the sixth inning closed, with Morgan’s team
a score in the lead.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FINAL SCORE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>From that time to the end the game was exciting,
both sides playing fast ball. In the beginning of the
seventh Morgan struck out again. Packard flied out
to Gamp. Mason got first on balls, but Starbright put
a liner into Frank Merriwell’s hands.</p>

<p>Of course Merriwell’s team did its best, but Morgan
was in fine form, and he permitted not a hit, Dick Merriwell
being thrown out at first by Mason, Ready
fanning, and Carson hitting to second.</p>

<p>The eighth opened with Mulloy at bat once more.
He smashed a hot one through Ready, who made his
second error in the game. Gallup advanced the Irish
youth a bag on a sacrifice, Merriwell throwing the
long-legged youth out at first.</p>

<p>Another sacrifice by Jones brought Mulloy up to
third; but Skelding proved unable to drive in another
run, his long fly being taken by Gamp.</p>

<p>Hodge frowned when he found himself up again
with no one ahead of him on the bags. He led off
with a hit. Browning tried to sacrifice, but put up
an infield fly, forcing Bart to get back to first. The
ball was captured by Mason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>As Gamp came to bat, Bart took a desperate chance,
and again stole second.</p>

<p>“Now for a clean hit!” sighed Jack Ready.</p>

<p>Gamp smashed the ball, sending it far into the field,
but Jones got under it. Hodge took a chance and
sprinted for third. Jones made a handsome throw,
and Bart was out by four feet, which ended the Merries’
chance for tieing the score in that inning.</p>

<p>Morgan’s team had not given up hope of making
more runs, and they came to bat with considerable
ginger in the first of the ninth.</p>

<p>Dunnerwurst pranced out with his stick, and again
invited the fielders to “mofe pack nearer.” Knowing
that Hans was liable to strike at almost anything, Dick
started with a high ball.</p>

<p>The Dutch lad hit it, and the ball went out between
first and second.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you toldt me so!” whooped Hans, as he
scooted for first.</p>

<p>It seemed like a safe hit, but Carson was playing
short, and the ball came to him on a beautiful bound.
He picked it up cleanly and threw without a moment
of delay to first.</p>

<p>“Out!” cried the umpire, as the ball spanked into
Browning’s mitt, a moment before Hans reached the
bag.</p>

<p>“Roppery! roppery!” yelled the excited Dutch lad.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
“Dot vos a goot pase-hit, und he hat no pusiness to
throw me oudt alretty!”</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell laughed. Dade Morgan tried to secure
a pass to first, but found he could not do so,
being compelled to hit. He drove the ball hard at
Harry, who fancied he had it cold, but a bad bound
caused Rattleton to fumble, which let Dade down to
first by a second.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” cried Barney Mulloy. “Now we’re in th’
game! It’s too bad to do it, but it can’t be hilped.
Crack it out, Packard, me bhoy!”</p>

<p>Dick began on Oliver with the jump ball, and Morgan’s
second-baseman fanned twice at the first two.
Then the young pitcher wasted two balls, after which
he again used the jump ball, and Packard struck out.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you, Dade!” cried Jack Ready.
“You’re anchored there.”</p>

<p>Thus far Mason had made two hits during the
game, one of them being a two-bagger. Dick regarded
Hock as dangerous, and yet he had considerable
confidence in his backing. An in shoot deceived Hock,
who batted the ball straight at Merriwell.</p>

<p>Frank gathered it up easily, tossing it over to Rattleton
in time to catch Morgan on a force, which retired
the final man of the Mysteries.</p>

<p>“Hold them down, Morgan,” said Packard, “and
the game is ours.”</p>

<p>Morgan was determined to do everything in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
power, and he succeeded in striking out Swiftwing,
which was a good start.</p>

<p>Frank walked out with his bat. He knew the case
was desperate, and he did not wish to lose the game.
Yet Morgan had pitched splendidly.</p>

<p>Dade knew Frank had a way of “cutting ice” at
critical times, and he did his best to fool Merry. By
accident more than otherwise, Dade finally put a fine
swift ball right over the plate. Merry met it fairly,
and the ball went out on a line.</p>

<p>A shout arose, and Frank flew to first.</p>

<p>“Go on!” shrieked a coacher.</p>

<p>He did not wait to see where the ball was, but kept
on to second. The uproar was great, but Frank saw
Ready by third motioning for him to come on, and he
did not let up. As he came near third Ready motioned
for him to stop, but not to slide.</p>

<p>It was a clean three-bagger. But Merriwell had not
scored, and Morgan’s team was still one run ahead.</p>

<p>Rattleton was the striker, and he had not made a
hit for the day. Morgan resolved that he should not.
Harry pretended to be anxious to hit, but he really
longed to get first on balls. Dade drove him into a
hole, however, by getting two strikes called on him.</p>

<p>Then Mulloy returned the ball to Morgan on a slow
throw, and Frank Merriwell scooted for home instantly.
It was a desperate thing to do and brought
every witness up standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>Morgan shook with excitement. The moment he
caught the ball he threw it, and his throw was bad.
Merry slid, while Mulloy fumbled the ball just long
enough to let the run in.</p>

<p>The score was tied, and again the Yale cheer came
from the group of students about Inza and Elsie.</p>

<p>Dick ran out and grasped Frank’s hand, his face
glowing.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was fine!” he cried. “No one but you
would have dared try it!”</p>

<p>“Something had to be done,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>Crowfoot grunted when they approached the bench.</p>

<p>“Heap slick!” he said.</p>

<p>The old Indian seemed to enjoy a game of baseball
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Rattleton, compelled to strike, hit the next ball, but
sent it straight into the hands of Gallup.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a case of an extra inning,” said Merry.</p>

<p>Dick walked out to strike. Morgan put one over,
and the boy lined it out for a single.</p>

<p>Then it was Ready’s turn, and Jack promptly bunted
toward third, beating the ball to first. Dick had
reached second, and, aroused by Frank’s example, the
lad soon stole third.</p>

<p>Ready remained on first. When Morgan pitched
the next time Jack loafed down from first, purposely
permitting himself to be cornered between the bases.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
Then Ready played back and forth, getting up as
much excitement as possible.</p>

<p>In the midst of this excitement Dick Merriwell
dashed for home. Packard had the ball, and he threw
home to stop the run. The boy, however, was running
like a streak, and he shot forward in a long, clean
slide.</p>

<p>The ball reached Mulloy a moment too late, and
Dick was safe at the plate, having stolen home with
the winning run.</p>

<p>Then there was an uproar, for the Yale men came
pouring upon the field, Inza and Elsie with them,
while Old Joe walked out and put his arms round the
lad who had won his own game in the ninth.</p>

<p>“You heap much like Steady Hand!” exclaimed
the redskin. “Um two make heap hot stuff!
Whoop!”</p>

<p>Inza burned up and grasped both of Dick’s hands.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” she laughed. “You are a Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Elsie impulsively threw her arms round Dick, and
kissed him. Then she started back, her face crimson;
but it could be no more crimson than was that
of the boy, who looked from Inza to Elsie, unable
to speak for a moment.</p>

<p>At last he said:</p>

<p>“Thank you! I am sure I could do better next
time if I knew you were watching.”</p>

<p>“King Richard,” cried Inza, “I decorate you with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
the badge of honor&mdash;the Yale blue! Some day, when
you go to Yale, you will wear it, I hope. If so, I
know you will defend it as bravely and nobly as your
brother has defended the blue, and you will be an
honor to Old Eli.”</p>
